Ion gradients across cell membranes establish a membrane voltage potential between the intracellular and extracellular fluid. Action potentials are the result of highly controlled biochemical events that actively change this membrane voltage. Under sufficient stimulus this change in voltage or depolarization leads to a current propagation and signal transduction between neurons. This paper discusses the fundamental equations derived by Hodgkin and Huxley for the biophysical analysis of neuronal action potentials. NOMENCLATURE Action potential, Hodgkin and Huxley, biophysical modeling. INTRODUCTION Neurons are highly specialized cells that form the basis of cognition and autonomic control. They are composed of a cell body, dendrites, axon, and the axon terminal or synaptic bouton. See figure 1. Each of these structures play an essential role in the function of the typical neuron. Dendrites receive chemical information from other neurons, i.e. neurotransmitters, and transform this chemical signal either into a metabolic change in the neuron or an electrical signal in the form of ion influx and/or efflux which causes a voltage difference in the neuron. If the voltage difference reaches a threshold, the neuron “fires” an action potential that will travel through the axon at a constant voltage amplitude. Once in the synaptic bouton, the electric signal is converted into a chemical signal that will stimulate or inhibit a neighboring neuron. The summation of thousands of various inputs will determine whether the neuron will fire or not. Electrochemical Gradient To understand an action potential, it is essential to understand the electrochemical gradient and reversal potentials of each ion that contributes to the resting membrane potential of the neuron i.e. the unexcited or resting state of the neuron. Figure 1. Schematic of Neurons Image by Clker-Free-Vector-Images from Pixabay The ion concentration gradient is the result of active pumps that spend chemical energy to move ions against their electrochemical gradient. This process leads to a steady state where the membrane potential difference relative to the extracellular fluid is constant. This potential difference is the resting membrane potential , given by (1), and is approximately . (1) The reversal potential or equilibrium potential is given by the Nernst equation (2) and calculates the voltage that generates a steady state in the influx and efflux of a specific ion, , relative to its concentrations in different compartments. (2) Eq 2. Nernst Equation Where is the gas constant, is the temperature in Kelvin, the valence of the ion, the Faraday constant and and the extracellular and intracellular concentrations of the ion of interest, respectively. Reversal potential values for the major ions that contribute to the resting membrane potential are given in Table 1, (Raimondo et al., 2015).\\nSebastian Valencia-Amores. Biophysical Model of Neuronal Action Potential: Hodgkin and Huxley Review/ JAEM 5 (2020) pp-pp Journal of Applied Engineering Mathematics December 2020, Vol. 7 2 Copyright © 2020 by ME505 BYU Typical Resting membrane Ion [Intracellular] [Extracellular] In:Out 96 mM 4 mM 24:1 -85 mV 10 mM 145 mM 1:14.5 +71mV 70 nM 2 mM 7:200,000 +137 mV 7 mM 145 mM 7:145 -80 mV Table 1. Table of typical resting membrane intracellular and extracellular concentrations of ions Where [Intracellular] and [Extracellular] refer to the concentrations inside and outside the cell, respectively and refers to the reversal potential of the given ion. The difference among these concentrations and the change of ion permeability in the cell are ultimately the driving force of an action potential. Ion channels Ion channels can be thought of as a pore in the cell membrane formed by assembling modules of proteins. The composition of these modules, named subunits, regulates the channel kinetics and the permeability of ions in the neuron. Ion channels are often selective in their permeability allowing only specific ions to cross. A positive voltage change relative to the resting membrane potential is referred to as depolarization, and a negative voltage change about resting membrane potential is referred to as hyperpolarization. The modulation of the opening and closing of ion channels is referred to as gating. There are four main types of channels classified by their gating. These are: mechanically gated channels, voltage gated channels, ligand gated channels and leak channels. For brevity, I will omit mechanical gates. Voltage gated channels modulate their activity depending on voltage. Some exhibit two gates: the first gate, named the activation gate is voltage sensitive and opens after the membrane potential reaches a threshold voltage. In fact, this behavior is a probabilistic function, as the potential difference across the membrane gets nearer to the threshold voltage, the probability that the activation gate opens increases correspondingly. The second gate, the inactivation gate, initially thought to be voltage sensitive was later shown to lack this property. (Bezanilla and Armstrong, 1977) Instead, it acts when the activation gate is partially or fully active. As the name suggests, the inactivation gate, closes the channel. Ligand gated channels convert chemical input into electrical signals. When an action potential reaches the axon terminal, the neuron releases neurotransmitters directly to its neighboring neurons. Neurotransmitters interact with ligand gated channels causing these channels to open and allow ions to cross into or out of the neuron, depending on the ion and the reversal potential. The summation of the activity of thousands of ligand gated channels will determine if the voltage threshold is reached or not. If threshold is reached, voltage gated channels will be activated, and an action potential is imminent. Leak channels are passive channels that allow ions to flow down their electrochemical gradient. As discussed, these along with transporters establish the resting membrane potential. Action Potential An action potential is a highly coordinated biochemical and electrical event that describes the transmission of electrical signals from neuron to neuron. It occurs in an all or none fashion i.e. once the membrane reaches threshold, an action potential starts and it will finish even if no additional input is provided; similarly, if a stimulus is not strong enough to reach threshold, there will be no action potential. Given that a voltage difference decays through distance, after an action potential has been initiated the axon regenerates the potential difference along its length so that it propagates the action with the same voltage amplitude throughout the length of the neuron. A typical neuron receives thousands of neurotransmitter inputs from other neurons, some of these depolarize while some hyperpolarize the neuron and others modulate the receptivity of the neuron. If the summation of these postsynaptic voltage changes reaches the voltage threshold, around , sodium voltage gated channels open and allow sodium ions to rush into the cell causing a fast depolarization towards the sodium equilibrium potential. At the same threshold, potassium voltage gated channels start opening, but since they have slower kinetics, they do not fully open until the neuron depolarizes to around . By about this time, the sodium inactivation gates close the sodium voltage channels and stop sodium from entering the cell. At the same time, potassium ions continue to rush out of their open voltage gated channels and cause a rapid repolarization of the neuron towards the potassium equilibrium potential of . As the neuron repolarizes, the voltage gates of the sodium voltage gated channel open once again, but any sodium ion influx is still largely prevented by the closed inactivation gate which opens later.

Biophysical Model of Neuronal Action Potential: Hodgkin and Huxley Review/ JAEM 5 (2020) pp-pp Journal of Applied Engineering Mathematics December 2020, Vol. 7 3 Copyright © 2020 by ME505 BYU Given the slow kinetics of the potassium voltage gated channels, the membrane potential hyperpolarizes for a period until the potassium voltage gated channels close and the neuron reaches the membrane resting potential, see figure 2. The process then repeats given a strong enough stimulus to reach threshold. Figure 2. Schematic of an action potential Neuronal activity as an equivalent electric circuit During the experiments of Hodgkin and Huxley, neurons were stimulated with an electric current and their response was measured under different ion concentrations. This allowed Hodgkin and Huxley to discover the most fundamental biophysical aspects of neuronal signal transmission such as the different ions responsible for the action potential. (Hodgkin & Huxley, 1952). In analyzing neuronal responses, Hodgkin and Huxley formulated an equivalent electric circuit to represent the electrophysiology of the membrane. They modeled the neuronal activity as a parallel circuit with a capacitor, variable resistors, and several batteries. The membrane of a neuron essentially behaves like a dielectric between two conducting plates while the gated ion channels behave like variable resistors and the batteries are given by the equilibrium potential, the driving force, of each ion. For simplicity, only sodium and potassium voltage gated ion channels are considered. While there are several ion channels in a real neuron, these are accounted by the variable resistor labeled “leak channels”. In this scenario a neuron that is externally stimulated by a current is modelled by the equivalent circuit in figure 3. Biophysical model of neuronal activity: Hodgkin and Huxley Let us consider the conservation of current as a function of time. (3) Where represents the externally applied current, the current that goes to the capacitor, the current through the sodium voltage gated channel, the current through the potassium voltage gated channel, and the current through the “leak channels.” Capacitance is given by (4). (4) Taking the derivative with respect to time of (4) results in (5). (5) Notice that denotes current. Therefore, the current through the capacitor is expressed as (6). (6) Substitute (6) into (3). (7) Using Ohm’s Law, the current through the channels can be expressed as (8).

Biophysical Model of Neuronal Action Potential: Hodgkin and Huxley Review/ JAEM 5 (2020) pp-pp Journal of Applied Engineering Mathematics December 2020, Vol. 7 4 Copyright © 2020 by ME505 BYU Using the definitions from (8) and (9) and replacing into (7) we get (10). 𝐼𝑒𝑥𝑡 𝑡 = 𝐶𝑑𝑉 𝑑𝑡+ 1 𝑅𝑁𝑎 (𝑉− 𝐸𝑁𝑎) + 1 𝑅𝐾 (𝑉− 𝐸𝐾) + 1 𝑅𝐿 (𝑉− 𝐸𝐿) (10) Notice that denotes the conductance of a channel, given by . Moreover, the conductance of a channel depends on the intrinsic properties of the channel ( ) and the probability that the channel is in the open or closed configuration ( ). That is: (11) To model , we denote as the probability that a single occurrence, can be thought of as a subunit, in the channel is in the open configuration and therefore, is the probability that an occurrence in the channel is closed. We can then write a reversible reaction representation for the opening and closing of the channel occurrences. (12) Furthermore, the configuration of an occurrence depends on time and the voltage difference across the membrane. As a result, the forward and reverse reactions are both associated with voltage dependent functions expressed in terms of time. These are defined as for the forward reaction and for the reverse reaction. Thus, the probability of a transition between configurations is given by: (13) (14) Where eq (13) gives the probability that a closed occurrence, opens in time and eq (14) gives the probability that an open occurrence closes in time. Using (13) and (14) we can describe the change in the probability that an occurrence is in the open state (15). (15) Rearranging (15) results in (16). (16) We consider steady state i.e. = 0, which gives the solution as as a function of voltage. (17) Since is in units of time, it will be denoted by the time constant . Eq (16) can now be reduced to (18) which is used to model the probability that an occurrence in the potassium channel opens with respect to time. (18) While the activity of the potassium channel is only affected by its activation gate, the sodium channel has two gates, the activation and inactivation gates. The leak channel is modeled without a gate. Consequently, the probability that the sodium channel opens is modeled with two variables, , to account for the activation and inactivation gates, respectively. Following the same derivation for Eq (18) we get the following differential equations (19, 20) that model the probabilities that the occurrences of the sodium channels open with respect to time. (19) (20) Using equations (18,19,20) a more complete description of channel conductance can be formulated for the sodium and potassium channels. Since the opening of an ion channel is the result of several occurrences opening together, which can be thought of as the channel subunits opening, the probability that the ion channel is open is the product of the probability that the channel’s single occurrences are open. To match experimental data, was empirically determined to be a quartic function, a cubic function, and remained to the first power. Potassium channel conductance is then given by (21) and sodium channel conductance is given by (22). (21) (22) If occurrences in the potassium channel are assumed to be independent, eq (21) suggests that there are four occurrences that govern the probability that the ion channel is open. This assumption matches structural data as potassium ion channels have four separate subunits that make up the channel. Sodium channels occurrences are not independent structurally. Using equations (21, 22) eq (10) becomes (23). Sebastian Valencia-Amores.

These specialized cells encode information via action potentials that propagate from neuron to neuron forming the underlying mechanism for motor control, thought and life as we experience it. One of the fundamental ways to study the nervous system is by analyzing the changes in neuronal electrical activity. This paper describes action potentials, and the biophysical model given by Hodgkin and Huxley in 1952. This model has been the framework for modern computational neuroscience and is still valuable for its adaptability, as it allows the incorporation of new elements to model different ion channels and predict how neurons will modulate their action potentials.

The most significant disadvantage of this model is that it does not contain neuronal adaptation, so that it cannot describe an experimentally measured spike train in response to constant input current. Again, the spike response model or the adaptive integrate-and-fire model enables to prediction of the spike train in the output for arbitrary time-dependent input, whereas an artificial neuron or a simple leaky integrate-and-fire does not.\\n\\nFULL CONTENT:\\n![](/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png)\\n![Wikipedia](/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg)\\n![The Free Encyclopedia](/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg)\\n\\n## Contents\\n\\n# Biological neuron model\\n\\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | **This article has multiple issues.** Please help **[improve it](/wiki/Special:EditPage/Biological_neuron_model \"Special:EditPage/Biological neuron model\")** or discuss these issues on the **[talk page](/wiki/Talk:Biological_neuron_model \"Talk:Biological neuron model\")**. *([Learn how and when to remove these messages](/wiki/Help:Maintenance_template_removal \"Help:Maintenance template removal\"))* |  |  | | --- | --- | |  | This article\\'s **tone or style may not reflect the [encyclopedic tone](/wiki/Wikipedia:Writing_better_articles#Tone \"Wikipedia:Writing better articles\") used on Wikipedia**.

Neurons (or nerve cells) are [electrically excitable](/wiki/Membrane_potential \"Membrane potential\") cells within the [nervous system](/wiki/Nervous_system \"Nervous system\"), able to fire electric signals, called [action potentials](/wiki/Action_potentials \"Action potentials\"), across a [neural network.](/wiki/Neural_network_(biology) \"Neural network (biology)\") These mathematical models describe the role of the biophysical and geometrical characteristics of neurons on the conduction of electrical activity.\\n\\nCentral to these models is the description of how the [membrane potential](/wiki/Membrane_potential \"Membrane potential\") (that is, the difference in [electric potential](/wiki/Electric_potential \"Electric potential\") between the interior and the exterior of a biological [cell](/wiki/Cell_(biology) \"Cell (biology)\")) across the [cell membrane](/wiki/Cell_membrane \"Cell membrane\") changes over time. In an experimental setting, stimulating neurons with an electrical current generates an [action potential](/wiki/Action_potential \"Action potential\") (or spike), that propagates down the neuron\\'s [axon](/wiki/Axon \"Axon\"). This axon can branch out and connect to a large number of downstream neurons at sites called [synapses](/wiki/Synapse \"Synapse\"). At these synapses, the spike can cause the release of [neurotransmitters](/wiki/Neurotransmitter \"Neurotransmitter\"), which in turn can change the voltage potential of downstream neurons. This change can potentially lead to even more spikes in those downstream neurons, thus passing down the signal. As many as 95% of neurons in the [neocortex](/wiki/Neocortex \"Neocortex\"), the outermost layer of the [mammalian](/wiki/Mammal \"Mammal\") [brain](/wiki/Brain \"Brain\"), consist of excitatory [pyramidal neurons](/wiki/Pyramidal_cell \"Pyramidal cell\"),[[2]](#cite_note-2)[[3]](#cite_note-3) and each pyramidal neuron receives tens of thousands of inputs from other neurons.[[4]](#cite_note-4) Thus, spiking neurons are a major information processing unit of the [nervous system](/wiki/Nervous_system \"Nervous system\").\\n\\nOne such example of a spiking neuron model may be a highly detailed mathematical model that includes spatial [morphology](/wiki/Morphology_(biology) \"Morphology (biology)\"). Another may be a conductance-based neuron model that views neurons as points and describes the membrane voltage dynamics as a function of trans-membrane currents. A mathematically simpler \"integrate-and-fire\" model significantly simplifies the description of [ion channel](/wiki/Ion_channel \"Ion channel\") and membrane potential dynamics (initially studied by Lapique in 1907).[[5]](#cite_note-5)[[6]](#cite_note-6)\\n\\n## Biological background, classification, and aims of neuron models\\n\\n**Non-spiking cells, spiking cells, and their measurement**\\n\\nNot all the cells of the nervous system produce the type of spike that defines the scope of the spiking neuron models. For example, [cochlear](/wiki/Cochlea \"Cochlea\") [hair cells](/wiki/Hair_cells \"Hair cells\"), [retinal receptor cells](/wiki/Photoreceptor_cell \"Photoreceptor cell\"), and [retinal bipolar cells](/wiki/Retinal_bipolar_cell \"Retinal bipolar cell\") do not spike. Furthermore, many cells in the nervous system are not classified as neurons but instead are classified as [glia](/wiki/Glial_cell \"Glial cell\").\\n\\nNeuronal activity can be measured with different experimental techniques, such as the \"Whole cell\" measurement technique, which captures the spiking activity of a single neuron and produces full amplitude action potentials.\\n\\nWith extracellular measurement techniques, one or more electrodes are placed in the [extracellular space](/wiki/Extracellular_space \"Extracellular space\"). Spikes, often from several spiking sources, depending on the size of the electrode and its proximity to the sources, can be identified with signal processing techniques. Extracellular measurement has several advantages:\\n\\n**Overview of neuron models**\\n\\nNeuron models can be divided into two categories according to the physical units of the interface of the model. Each category could be further divided according to the abstraction/detail level:\\n\\nAlthough it is not unusual in science and engineering to have several descriptive models for different abstraction/detail levels, the number of different, sometimes contradicting, biological neuron models is exceptionally high. This situation is partly the result of the many different experimental settings, and the difficulty to separate the intrinsic properties of a single neuron from measurement effects and interactions of many cells ([network](/wiki/Biological_neural_network \"Biological neural network\") effects).\\n\\n**Aims of neuron models**\\n\\nUltimately, biological neuron models aim to explain the mechanisms underlying the operation of the nervous system. However, several approaches can be distinguished, from more realistic models (e.g., mechanistic models) to more pragmatic models (e.g., phenomenological models).[[7]](#cite_note-7)[*[better\\xa0source\\xa0needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS \"Wikipedia:NOTRS\")*] Modeling helps to analyze experimental data and address questions. Models are also important in the context of restoring lost brain functionality through [neuroprosthetic](/wiki/Neuroprosthetics \"Neuroprosthetics\") devices.\\n\\n## Electrical input–output membrane voltage models\\n\\nThe models in this category describe the relationship between neuronal membrane currents at the input stage and membrane voltage at the output stage. This category includes (generalized) integrate-and-fire models and biophysical models inspired by the work of Hodgkin–Huxley in the early 1950s using an experimental setup that punctured the cell membrane and allowed to force a specific membrane voltage/current.[[8]](#cite_note-Hod52-8)[[9]](#cite_note-:6-9)[[10]](#cite_note-:7-10)[[11]](#cite_note-:8-11)\\n\\nMost modern [electrical neural interfaces](#ElectricalApplications) apply extra-cellular electrical stimulation to avoid membrane puncturing, which can lead to cell death and tissue damage. Hence, it is not clear to what extent the electrical neuron models hold for extra-cellular stimulation (see e.g.[[12]](#cite_note-:9-12)).\\n\\n### Hodgkin–Huxley\\n\\nExperimental evidence supporting the model\\n\\n| Property of the H&H model | References |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| The shape of an individual spike | [[8]](#cite_note-Hod52-8)[[9]](#cite_note-:6-9)[[10]](#cite_note-:7-10)[[11]](#cite_note-:8-11) |\\n| The identity of the ions involved | [[8]](#cite_note-Hod52-8)[[9]](#cite_note-:6-9)[[10]](#cite_note-:7-10)[[11]](#cite_note-:8-11) |\\n| Spike speed across the axon | [[8]](#cite_note-Hod52-8) |\\n\\nThe Hodgkin–Huxley model (H&H model)[[8]](#cite_note-Hod52-8)[[9]](#cite_note-:6-9)[[10]](#cite_note-:7-10)[[11]](#cite_note-:8-11)\\nis a model of the relationship between the flow of ionic currents across the neuronal cell membrane and the membrane voltage of the cell.[[8]](#cite_note-Hod52-8)[[9]](#cite_note-:6-9)[[10]](#cite_note-:7-10)[[11]](#cite_note-:8-11) It consists of a set of [nonlinear differential equations](/wiki/Nonlinear_system#Nonlinear_differential_equations \"Nonlinear system\") describing the behavior of ion channels that permeate the cell membrane of the [squid giant axon](/wiki/Squid_giant_axon \"Squid giant axon\"). Hodgkin and Huxley were awarded the 1963 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this work.\\n\\nIt is important to note the voltage-current relationship, with multiple voltage-dependent currents charging the cell membrane of capacity *C*m\\n\\n![{\\\\displaystyle C_{\\\\mathrm {m} }{\\\\frac {dV(t)}{dt}}=-\\\\sum _{i}I_{i}(t,V).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/403ee6f66242e21f5b32b312bf83883a4150af0f)\\n\\nThe above equation is the time [derivative](/wiki/Derivative \"Derivative\") of the law of [capacitance](/wiki/Capacitor#Capacitance_instability \"Capacitor\"), *Q* = *CV* where the change of the total charge must be explained as the sum over the currents.

Typically, these include inward Ca2+ and Na+ input currents, as well as several varieties of K+ outward currents, including a \"leak\" current.\\n\\nThe result can be at the small end of 20 parameters which one must estimate or measure for an accurate model. In a model of a complex system of neurons, [numerical integration](/wiki/Numerical_integration \"Numerical integration\") of the equations are [computationally expensive](/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms \"Analysis of algorithms\"). Careful simplifications of the Hodgkin–Huxley model are therefore needed.\\n\\nThe model can be reduced to two dimensions thanks to the dynamic relations which can be established between the gating variables.[[13]](#cite_note-13) it is also possible to extend it to take into account the evolution of the concentrations (considered fixed in the original model).[[14]](#cite_note-14)[[15]](#cite_note-15)\\n\\n### Perfect Integrate-and-fire\\n\\nOne of the earliest models of a neuron is the perfect integrate-and-fire model (also called non-leaky integrate-and-fire), first investigated in 1907 by [Louis Lapicque](/wiki/Louis_Lapicque \"Louis Lapicque\").[[16]](#cite_note-Abbott_1999-16) A neuron is represented by its membrane voltage *V* which evolves in time during stimulation with an input current *I(t)* according\\n\\n![{\\\\displaystyle I(t)=C{\\\\frac {dV(t)}{dt}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f7c1512d05714b994e2bbac91c28e49d91d01027)\\n\\nwhich is just the time [derivative](/wiki/Derivative \"Derivative\") of the law of [capacitance](/wiki/Capacitor#Capacitance_instability \"Capacitor\"), *Q* = *CV*. When an input current is applied, the membrane voltage increases with time until it reaches a constant threshold *V*th, at which point a [delta function](/wiki/Dirac_delta_function \"Dirac delta function\") spike occurs and the voltage is reset to its resting potential, after which the model continues to run. The *firing frequency* of the model thus increases linearly without bound as input current increases.\\n\\nThe model can be made more accurate by introducing a [refractory period](/wiki/Refractory_period_(physiology) \"Refractory period (physiology)\") *t*ref that limits the firing frequency of a neuron by preventing it from firing during that period. For constant input *I(t)=I* the threshold voltage is reached after an integration time tint=CVthr/I after starting from zero. After a reset, the refractory period introduces a dead time so that the total time until the next firing is *t*ref+*t*int . The firing frequency is the inverse of the total inter-spike interval (including dead time). The firing frequency as a function of a constant input current, is therefore\\n\\n![{\\\\displaystyle \\\\,\\\\!f(I)={\\\\frac {I}{C_{\\\\mathrm {} }V_{\\\\mathrm {th} }+t_{\\\\mathrm {ref} }I}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/706817effaf45cece672817c4b2af0f0737ca204)\\n\\nA shortcoming of this model is that it describes neither adaptation nor leakage. If the model receives a below-threshold short current pulse at some time, it will retain that voltage boost forever - until another input later makes it fire. This characteristic is not in line with observed neuronal behavior. The following extensions make the integrate-and-fire model more plausible from a biological point of view.\\n\\n### Leaky integrate-and-fire\\n\\nThe leaky integrate-and-fire model, which can be traced back to [Louis Lapicque](/wiki/Louis_Lapicque \"Louis Lapicque\"),[[16]](#cite_note-Abbott_1999-16) contains a \"leak\" term in the membrane potential equation that reflects the diffusion of ions through the membrane, unlike the non-leaky integrate-and-fire model. The model equation looks like[[1]](#cite_note-Gerstner_2002-1)\\n\\n![{\\\\displaystyle C_{\\\\mathrm {m} }{\\\\frac {dV_{\\\\mathrm {m} }(t)}{dt}}=I(t)-{\\\\frac {V_{\\\\mathrm {m} }(t)}{R_{\\\\mathrm {m} }}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e92554cf7c0b7e23cc634088c2e5e097765a1371)\\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Leaky_Integrate-and-Fire_model_neuron_%28schematic%29.jpg/250px-Leaky_Integrate-and-Fire_model_neuron_%28schematic%29.jpg)\\n\\nwhere *V*m is the voltage across the cell membrane and *R*m is the membrane resistance. (The non-leaky integrate-and-fire model is retrieved in the limit *R*m to infinity, i.e. if the membrane is a perfect insulator). The model equation is valid for arbitrary time-dependent input until a threshold  *V*th is reached; thereafter the membrane potential is reset.\\n\\nFor constant input, the minimum input to reach the threshold is *I*th = *V*th / *R*m. Assuming a reset to zero, the firing frequency thus looks like\\n\\n![{\\\\displaystyle f(I)={\\\\begin{cases}0,&I\\\\leq I_{\\\\mathrm {th} }\\\\\\\\\\\\left[t_{\\\\mathrm {ref} }-R_{\\\\mathrm {m} }C_{\\\\mathrm {m} }\\\\log \\\\left(1-{\\\\tfrac {V_{\\\\mathrm {th} }}{IR_{\\\\mathrm {m} }}}\\\\right)\\\\right]^{-1},&I>I_{\\\\mathrm {th} }\\\\end{cases}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3d2b9ee97278ff7f139dc76afecd9d3336a35a5b)\\n\\nwhich converges for large input currents to the previous leak-free model with the refractory period.[[17]](#cite_note-Koch98-17) The model can also be used for inhibitory neurons.[[18]](#cite_note-18)[[19]](#cite_note-Cejnar2020-19)\\n\\nThe most significant disadvantage of this model is that it does not contain neuronal adaptation, so that it cannot describe an experimentally measured spike train in response to constant input current.[[20]](#cite_note-20) This disadvantage is removed in generalized integrate-and-fire models that also contain one or several adaptation-variables and are able to predict spike times of cortical neurons under current injection to a high degree of accuracy.[[21]](#cite_note-21)[[22]](#cite_note-Jolivet_2006-22)[[23]](#cite_note-Pozzorini_2013-23)\\n\\n### Adaptive integrate-and-fire\\n\\nExperimental evidence supporting the model\\n\\n| Adaptive integrate-and-fire model model | References |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| Sub-threshold voltage for time-dependent input current | [[22]](#cite_note-Jolivet_2006-22)[[23]](#cite_note-Pozzorini_2013-23) |\\n| Firing times for time-dependent input current | [[22]](#cite_note-Jolivet_2006-22)[[23]](#cite_note-Pozzorini_2013-23) |\\n| Firing Patterns in response to step current input | [[24]](#cite_note-Gerstner_1996-24)[[25]](#cite_note-:17-25)[[26]](#cite_note-:2-26) |\\n\\nNeuronal adaptation refers to the fact that even in the presence of a constant current injection into the soma, the intervals between output spikes increase.

These equations capture the essence of spike generation by sodium and potassium ion channels. The basic mechanism of generating action potentials is a short influx of sodium ions that is followed by an efflux of potassium ions. This mechanism of spike generation is essentially preserved in higher organisms, so that with the choice of parameters give in Table [2.1](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S2.html#Ch2.T1 \"Table\\xa02.1 ‣ 2.2.1 Definition of the model ‣ 2.2 Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Chapter\\xa02 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part\\xa0I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks\\nand Models of Cognition\"), we have already a first approximate model of neurons in vertebrates. With a further change of parameters we could adapt the model equations to different temperatures so as to account for the fact that neurons at 37 degree Celsius behave differently than neurons in a lab preparation held at a room temperature of 21 degree Celsius.\\n\\n![Image 1](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/x40.png)\\n![Image 2](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/x41.png)\\n\\nFig.2.10:  Damped oscillations and a transient spike. Top. The voltage response to a step current shows a damped oscillation (arrow), a single rebound spike (asterisk) or repetitive firing. Bottom. Time course of the stimulating current.\\n\\nHowever, in order to account for the rich biophysics observed in the neurons of the vertebrate nervous system, two types of ion channel are not enough. Neurons come in different types and exhibit different electrical properties which in turn correspond to a large variety of different ion channels. Today, about 200 ion channels are known and many of these have been identified genetically ([419](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/bib.html#bib28 \"Channelpedia: an integrative and interactive database for ion channels\")). In experimental laboratories where the biophysics and functional role of ion channels is investigated, specific ion channel types can be blocked through pharmacological manipulations. In order to make predictions of blocking results, it is important to develop models that incorporate multiple ion channels. As we will see below (Section [2.3.1](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S3.html#SS1 \"2.3.1 Framework for biophysical neuron models ‣ 2.3 The Zoo of Ion Channels ‣ Chapter\\xa02 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part\\xa0I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks\\nand Models of Cognition\")), the mathematical framework of the Hodgkin-Huxley model is well suited for such an endeavor.\\n\\nFor other scientific questions, we may only be interested in the firing pattern of neurons and not in the biophysical mechanisms that give rise to it. Later in Part II of this book, we will show that generalized integrate-and-fire models can account for a large variety of neuronal firing patterns (Chapter [6](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch6.html \"Chapter\\xa06 Adaptation and Firing Patterns ‣ Part\\xa0II Generalized Integrate-and-Fire Neurons ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks\\nand Models of Cognition\")) and predict spike timings of real neurons with high precision (Chapter [11](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch11.html \"Chapter\\xa011 Encoding and Decoding with Stochastic Neuron models ‣ Part\\xa0II Generalized Integrate-and-Fire Neurons ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks\\nand Models of Cognition\")). Therefore, in Part III and IV of the book, where we focus on large networks of neurons, we mainly work with generalized integrate-and-fire rather than biophysical models. Nevertheless, biophysical models, i.e., Hodgkin-Huxley equations with multiple ion channels, serve as an important reference.\\n\\n2.3.1 Framework for biophysical neuron models\\n=============================================\\n\\nThe formalism of the Hodgkin-Huxley equation is extremely powerful, because it enables researchers to incorporate known ion channel types into a given neuron model. Just as before, the electrical properties of a patch of neuronal membrane are described by the conservation of current\\n\\nC d u d t=-∑k I k(t)+I(t),(2.10)\\n\\nbut in contrast to the simple Hodgkin-Huxley model discussed in the previous section, the right-hand side now contains all types of ion current found in a given neuron. For each ion channel type k, we introduce activation and inactivation variables\\n\\nI k(t)=g k([C a++],…)m p k h q k(u-E k),(2.11)\\n\\nwhere m and h describe activation and inactivation of the channel with equations analogous to Eq. ([2.6](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S2.html#Ch2.E6 \"(2.6) ‣ 2.2.1 Definition of the model ‣ 2.2 Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Chapter\\xa02 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part\\xa0I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks\\nand Models of Cognition\")), p k and q k are empirical parameters, E k is the reversal potential, and g k is the maximum conductance which may depend on secondary variables such as the concentration of calcium, magnesium, dopamine or other substances. In principle, if the dynamics of each channel type (i.e. all parameters that go into Eqs. ([2.11](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S3.html#Ch2.E11 \"(2.11) ‣ 2.3.1 Framework for biophysical neuron models ‣ 2.3 The Zoo of Ion Channels ‣ Chapter\\xa02 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part\\xa0I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks\\nand Models of Cognition\")) and ([2.6](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S2.html#Ch2.E6 \"(2.6) ‣ 2.2.1 Definition of the model ‣ 2.2 Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Chapter\\xa02 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part\\xa0I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks\\nand Models of Cognition\")) are available, then one needs only to know which channels are present in a given neuron in order to build a biophysical neuron model. Studying the composition of messenger RNA in a drop of liquid extracted from a neuron, gives a strong indication of which ion channel are present in a neuron, and which are not ([514](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/bib.html#bib2 \"Correlation maps allow neuronal electrical properties to be predicted from single-cell gene expression profiles in rat neocortex\")). The relative importance of ion channels is not fixed, but depends on the age of neuron as well as other factors. Indeed, a neuron can tune its spiking dynamics by regulating its ion channel composition via a modification of the gene expression profile.\\n\\nIon channels are complex transmembrane proteins which exist in many different forms. It is possible to classify an ion channel using (i) its genetic sequence; (ii) the ion type (sodium, potassium, calcium …) that can pass through the open channel; (iii) its voltage dependence; (iv) its sensitivity to second-messengers such as intra-cellular calcium; (v) its presumed functional role; (vi) its response to pharmacological drugs or to neuromodulators such as acetylcholine and dopamine.\\n\\nUsing a notation that mixes the classification schemes (i)-(iii), geneticists have distinguished multiple families of voltage-gated ion channels on the basis of similarities in the amino acid sequences. The channels are labeled with the chemical symbol of the ion of their selectivity, one or two letters denoting a distinct characteristic and a number to determine the sub-family. For instance ‘Kv5’ is the fifth sub-family of the voltage sensitive potassium channel family ‘Kv’. An additional number may be inserted to indicate the channel isoforms, for instance ‘Nav1.1’ is the first isoform that was found within the first subfamily of voltage-dependent sodium channels. Sometimes a lower-case letter is used to point to the splice variants (e.g. ‘Nav1.1a’). Strictly speaking, these names apply to a single cloned gene which corresponds to a channel subunit, whereas the full ion channel is composed of several subunits usually from a given family but possibly from different sub-families.\\n\\nTraditionally, electrophysiologists have identified channels with subscripts that reflect a combination of the classification schemes (ii)-(vi). The index of the potassium ‘M-current’ I M points to its response to pharmacological stimulation of Muscarinic (M) acetylcholine receptors. Another potassium current, I AHP, shapes the after-hyperpolarization (AHP) of the membrane potential after a spike. Thus the subscript corresponds to the presumed functional role of the channel. Sometimes the functionally characterized current can be related to the genetic classification; for instance I AHP is a calcium-dependent potassium channel associated with the small-conductance ‘SK’ family, but in other cases the link between an electrophysiologically characterized channel and its composition in terms of genetically identified subunits is still uncertain. Linking genetic expression with a functionally characterized ion currents is a fast-expanding field of study ([419](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/bib.html#bib28 \"Channelpedia: an integrative and interactive database for ion channels\")).\\n\\n| A | B |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| ![Image 3](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/x42.png) | ![Image 4](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/x43.png) |\\n\\nFig.2.11:  A modification of sodium channel kinetics leads to different neuronal dynamics. A. Response of a model with modified sodium channel to current steps of different amplitudes. B. Delayed spike initiation. A short current pulse of 2 ms duration is applied at t=8 ms. The action potential that is elicited in response to the current pulse is shown for decreasing pulse amplitudes (I=6.25;5.90;5.88 μ A/cm 2). Note that the action potential can occur more than 10 ms after the end of the current pulse. \\n\\nIn this section we select a few examples from the zoo of ion channels and illustrate how ion channels can modify the spiking dynamics. The aim is not to quantitatively specify parameters of each ionic current as this depends heavily on the genetic expression of the subunits, cell-type, temperature and neurotransmitters. Rather, we would like to explore qualitatively the influence of ion channel kinetics on neuronal properties. In other words, let us bring the zoo of ion channels to the circus and explore the stunning acts that can be achieved.\\n\\n2.3.2 Sodium Ion Channels and the Type-I Regime\\n===============================================\\n\\nThe parameters of the Hodgkin-Huxley model in Table [2.1](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S2.html#Ch2.T1 \"Table\\xa02.1 ‣ 2.2.1 Definition of the model ‣ 2.2 Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Chapter\\xa02 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part\\xa0I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks\\nand Models of Cognition\") relate to only one type of sodium and potassium ion channel. There are more than 10 different types of sodium channels, each with a slightly different activation and inactivation profile. However, as we will see, even a small change in the ion channel kinetics can profoundly affect the spiking characteristics of a neuron.\\n\\nLet us consider a sodium ion channel which has its inactivation curve h 0(u) (Fig. [2.3](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S2.html#Ch2.F3 \"Fig.\\xa02.3 ‣ 2.2.1 Definition of the model ‣ 2.2 Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Chapter\\xa02 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part\\xa0I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks\\nand Models of Cognition\")A) shifted to depolarized voltages by 20 mV compared to the parameters in Table [2.1](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S2.html#Ch2.T1 \"Table\\xa02.1 ‣ 2.2.1 Definition of the model ‣ 2.2 Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Chapter\\xa02 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part\\xa0I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks\\nand Models of Cognition\"). With maximal conductances g Na=25 nS/cm 2 and g K=40 nS/cm 2, the dynamics of a neuron with this modified sodium channel (Fig. [2.11](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S3.html#Ch2.F11 \"Fig.\\xa02.11 ‣ 2.3.1 Framework for biophysical neuron models ‣ 2.3 The Zoo of Ion Channels ‣ Chapter\\xa02 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part\\xa0I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks\\nand Models of Cognition\")) is qualitatively different from a neuron with the parameters as in Table [2.1](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S2.html#Ch2.T1 \"Table\\xa02.1 ‣ 2.2.1 Definition of the model ‣ 2.2 Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Chapter\\xa02 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part\\xa0I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks\\nand Models of Cognition\") (Figs.

A. Regular spiking response to constant input. B. Firing frequency as a function of the constant current.\\n\\nFirst, the neuron with the modified sodium dynamics shows no damped oscillations in response to a step input (Fig. [2.11](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S3.html#Ch2.F11 \"Fig.\\xa02.11 ‣ 2.3.1 Framework for biophysical neuron models ‣ 2.3 The Zoo of Ion Channels ‣ Chapter\\xa02 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part\\xa0I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks\\nand Models of Cognition\")A). Second, the neuron responds to a short current pulse which is just slightly above the firing threshold with a delayed action potential (Fig. [2.11](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S3.html#Ch2.F11 \"Fig.\\xa02.11 ‣ 2.3.1 Framework for biophysical neuron models ‣ 2.3 The Zoo of Ion Channels ‣ Chapter\\xa02 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part\\xa0I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks\\nand Models of Cognition\")B). Third, during regular spiking the shape of the action potential is slightly different in the model with the modified sodium channel (Fig. [2.12](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S3.html#Ch2.F12 \"Fig.\\xa02.12 ‣ 2.3.2 Sodium Ion Channels and the Type-I Regime ‣ 2.3 The Zoo of Ion Channels ‣ Chapter\\xa02 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part\\xa0I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks\\nand Models of Cognition\")A). In particular, the membrane potential between the spikes exhibits an inflection point, unlike the spike train with the original set of parameters (Fig. [2.7](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S2.html#Ch2.F7 \"Fig.\\xa02.7 ‣ Ion channel dynamics during spike generation ‣ 2.2.3 Dynamics ‣ 2.2 Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Chapter\\xa02 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part\\xa0I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks\\nand Models of Cognition\")A). Finally, the gain function (frequency-current plot) has no gap so that the neuron model can fire at arbitrarily small frequencies (Fig. [2.12](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S3.html#Ch2.F12 \"Fig.\\xa02.12 ‣ 2.3.2 Sodium Ion Channels and the Type-I Regime ‣ 2.3 The Zoo of Ion Channels ‣ Chapter\\xa02 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part\\xa0I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks\\nand Models of Cognition\")B). If we compare this f-I plot with the gain function of the neuron with parameters from Table [2.1](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S2.html#Ch2.T1 \"Table\\xa02.1 ‣ 2.2.1 Definition of the model ‣ 2.2 Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Chapter\\xa02 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part\\xa0I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks\\nand Models of Cognition\"), we can distinguish two types of excitability: Type I has a continuous input-output function (Fig. [2.12](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S3.html#Ch2.F12 \"Fig.\\xa02.12 ‣ 2.3.2 Sodium Ion Channels and the Type-I Regime ‣ 2.3 The Zoo of Ion Channels ‣ Chapter\\xa02 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part\\xa0I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks\\nand Models of Cognition\")B), while type II has a discontinuity (Fig. [2.7](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S2.html#Ch2.F7 \"Fig.\\xa02.7 ‣ Ion channel dynamics during spike generation ‣ 2.2.3 Dynamics ‣ 2.2 Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Chapter\\xa02 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part\\xa0I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks\\nand Models of Cognition\")B).\\n\\nA B\\n![Image 6](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/x45.png)![Image 7](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/x46.png)\\nC\\n![Image 8](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/x47.png)\\nD\\n![Image 9](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/x48.png)\\nE\\n![Image 10](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/x49.png)\\n\\nFig.2.13: Spike-frequency adaptation with I M.

The model with I M exhibits adaptation. E. Progressive activation of the potassium current I M during the repetitive spiking period shown in C.\\n\\n2.3.3 Adaptation and Refractoriness\\n===================================\\n\\nWe have seen in Sect. [2.2](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S2.html \"2.2 Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Chapter\\xa02 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part\\xa0I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks\\nand Models of Cognition\") that the combination of sodium and potassium channels generates spikes followed by a relative refractory period. The refractoriness is caused by the slow return of the sodium inactivation variable h and the potassium activation variable n to their equilibrium values. The time scale of recovery in the Hodgkin-Huxley model with parameters as in Table [2.1](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S2.html#Ch2.T1 \"Table\\xa02.1 ‣ 2.2.1 Definition of the model ‣ 2.2 Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Chapter\\xa02 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part\\xa0I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks\\nand Models of Cognition\"), is 4 ms for the potassium channel activation and 20 ms for the sodium channel inactivation. Other ion channel types, not present in the original Hodgkin-Huxley model, can affect the recovery process on much longer time scales and lead to spike-frequency adaptation: after stimulation with a step current, interspike intervals get successively longer. The basic mechanism of adaptation is the same as that of refractoriness: either a hyperpolarizing current is activated during a spike (and slowly de-activates thereafter) or a depolarizing current is inactivated during a spike and de-inactivates on a much slower time scale.\\n\\nExample: Slow Inactivation of a Hyperpolarizing Current\\n\\nLet us start with the muscarinic potassium channel I M, often called M-current. Genetically, the channel is composed of subunits of the Kv7 family. Figure [2.13](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S3.html#Ch2.F13 \"Fig.\\xa02.13 ‣ 2.3.2 Sodium Ion Channels and the Type-I Regime ‣ 2.3 The Zoo of Ion Channels ‣ Chapter\\xa02 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part\\xa0I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks\\nand Models of Cognition\")A-B shows the activation function as well as the voltage dependence of the time constant as characterized by Yamada et al. [1989]. The activation function (Figure [2.13](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S3.html#Ch2.F13 \"Fig.\\xa02.13 ‣ 2.3.2 Sodium Ion Channels and the Type-I Regime ‣ 2.3 The Zoo of Ion Channels ‣ Chapter\\xa02 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part\\xa0I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks\\nand Models of Cognition\")A) tells us that this channel tends to be activated at voltages above -40 mV and is de-activated below -40 mV with a very sharp transition between the two regimes. Since -40mV is well above the threshold of spike initiation, the membrane potential is never found above -40 mV except during the 1-2 ms of a spike. Therefore the channel partially activates during a spike and, after the end of the action potential, de-activates with a time-constant of 40- 60 ms (Figure [2.13](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S3.html#Ch2.F13 \"Fig.\\xa02.13 ‣ 2.3.2 Sodium Ion Channels and the Type-I Regime ‣ 2.3 The Zoo of Ion Channels ‣ Chapter\\xa02 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part\\xa0I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks\\nand Models of Cognition\")B). The slow deactivation of this potassium channel affects the time course of the membrane potential after a spike. Compared to the original Hodgkin-Huxley model which has only the two currents specified in Table [2.1](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S2.html#Ch2.T1 \"Table\\xa02.1 ‣ 2.2.1 Definition of the model ‣ 2.2 Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Chapter\\xa02 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part\\xa0I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks\\nand Models of Cognition\"), a model with an additional I M current exhibits a prolonged hyperpolarizing spike afterpotential and therefore a longer relative refractory period (Figure [2.13](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S3.html#Ch2.F13 \"Fig.\\xa02.13 ‣ 2.3.2 Sodium Ion Channels and the Type-I Regime ‣ 2.3 The Zoo of Ion Channels ‣ Chapter\\xa02 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part\\xa0I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks\\nand Models of Cognition\")C-E).\\n\\nIn the regular firing regime, it is possible that the M-current caused by a previous spike is still partially activated when the next spike is emitted. The partial activation can therefore accumulate over successive spikes. By cumulating over spikes, the activation of I M gradually forces the membrane potential away from the threshold, increasing the interspike interval. This results in a spiking response that appears to ’adapt’ to a step input, hence the name ‘spike-frequency adaptation’ or simply ‘adaptation’ (Figure [2.13](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S3.html#Ch2.F13 \"Fig.\\xa02.13 ‣ 2.3.2 Sodium Ion Channels and the Type-I Regime ‣ 2.3 The Zoo of Ion Channels ‣ Chapter\\xa02 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part\\xa0I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks\\nand Models of Cognition\")C-E).\\n\\nA B\\n![Image 11](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/x50.png)![Image 12](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/x51.png)\\nC\\n![Image 13](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/x52.png)\\nD\\n![Image 14](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/x53.png)\\nE\\n![Image 15](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/x54.png)\\n\\nFig.2.14: I A and the refractory period.

Progressive activation (solid line) and inactivation (dashed line) of the potassium current I A during the stimulation shown in C and D. \\n\\nExample: A-current\\n\\nI A is another potassium ion channel with kinetics similar to I M, but qualitatively different effects: I A makes the relative refractory period longer and stronger without causing much adaptation. To see the distinction between I A and I M, we compare the activation kinetics of both channels (Figure [2.13](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S3.html#Ch2.F13 \"Fig.\\xa02.13 ‣ 2.3.2 Sodium Ion Channels and the Type-I Regime ‣ 2.3 The Zoo of Ion Channels ‣ Chapter\\xa02 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part\\xa0I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks\\nand Models of Cognition\")B and [2.14](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S3.html#Ch2.F14 \"Fig.\\xa02.14 ‣ 2.3.3 Adaptation and Refractoriness ‣ 2.3 The Zoo of Ion Channels ‣ Chapter\\xa02 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part\\xa0I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks\\nand Models of Cognition\")B). The time constant τ m of activation is much faster for I A than for I M. This implies that the A-current increases rapidly during the short time of the spike and decays quickly afterward. In other words, the effect of I A is short and strong whereas the effect of I M is long and small. Because the effect of I A does not last as long, it contributes to refractoriness, but only very little to spike frequency adaptation ([2.14](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S3.html#Ch2.F14 \"Fig.\\xa02.14 ‣ 2.3.3 Adaptation and Refractoriness ‣ 2.3 The Zoo of Ion Channels ‣ Chapter\\xa02 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part\\xa0I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks\\nand Models of Cognition\") C-E).

solve [sine](/wiki/Sine \"Sine\") and [cosine](/wiki/Cosine \"Cosine\") functions and a prototypical computer implementing it.[[10]](#cite_note-Volder_1956-10)[[11]](#cite_note-Volder_2000-11) The report also discussed the possibility to compute hyperbolic [coordinate rotation](/wiki/Coordinate_rotation \"Coordinate rotation\"), [logarithms](/wiki/Logarithm \"Logarithm\") and [exponential functions](/wiki/Exponential_function \"Exponential function\") with modified CORDIC algorithms.[[10]](#cite_note-Volder_1956-10)[[11]](#cite_note-Volder_2000-11) Utilizing CORDIC for [multiplication](/wiki/Multiplication \"Multiplication\") and [division](/wiki/Division_(mathematics) \"Division (mathematics)\") was also conceived at this time.[[11]](#cite_note-Volder_2000-11) Based on the CORDIC principle, Dan\\xa0H.\\xa0Daggett, a colleague of Volder at Convair, developed conversion algorithms between binary and [binary-coded decimal](/wiki/Binary-coded_decimal \"Binary-coded decimal\") (BCD).[[11]](#cite_note-Volder_2000-11)[[14]](#cite_note-Daggett_1959-14)\\n\\nIn 1958, Convair finally started to build a demonstration system to solve [radar fix](/wiki/Radar_fix \"Radar fix\")–taking problems named *CORDIC I*, completed in 1960 without Volder, who had left the company already.[[1]](#cite_note-Volder_1959_1-1)[[11]](#cite_note-Volder_2000-11) More universal *CORDIC II* models *A* (stationary) and *B* (airborne) were built and tested by Daggett and Harry Schuss in 1962.[[11]](#cite_note-Volder_2000-11)[[15]](#cite_note-ASG_1962-15)\\n\\nVolder\\'s CORDIC algorithm was first described in public in 1959,[[1]](#cite_note-Volder_1959_1-1)[[2]](#cite_note-Volder_1959_2-2)[[11]](#cite_note-Volder_2000-11)[[13]](#cite_note-Schmid_1983-13)[[16]](#cite_note-Schmid_1974-16) which caused it to be incorporated into navigation computers by companies including [Martin-Orlando](/wiki/Martin-Orlando \"Martin-Orlando\"), [Computer Control](/wiki/Computer_Control \"Computer Control\"), [Litton](/wiki/Litton_Industries \"Litton Industries\"), [Kearfott](/wiki/Kearfott \"Kearfott\"), [Lear-Siegler](/wiki/Lear-Siegler \"Lear-Siegler\"), [Sperry](/wiki/Sperry_Rand \"Sperry Rand\"), [Raytheon](/wiki/Raytheon \"Raytheon\"), and [Collins Radio](/wiki/Collins_Radio \"Collins Radio\").[[11]](#cite_note-Volder_2000-11)\\n\\nVolder teamed up with Malcolm McMillan to build *Athena*, a [fixed-point](/wiki/Fixed-point_arithmetic \"Fixed-point arithmetic\") [desktop calculator](/wiki/Desktop_calculator \"Desktop calculator\") utilizing his binary CORDIC algorithm.[[17]](#cite_note-Leibson_2010_2-17) The design was introduced to [Hewlett-Packard](/wiki/Hewlett-Packard \"Hewlett-Packard\") in June 1965, but not accepted.[[17]](#cite_note-Leibson_2010_2-17) Still, McMillan introduced [David S. Cochran](/w/index.php?title=David_S._Cochran&action=edit&redlink=1 \"David S. Cochran (page does not exist)\") (HP) to Volder\\'s algorithm and when Cochran later met Volder he referred him to a similar approach [John\\xa0E. Meggitt](/w/index.php?title=John_E._Meggitt&action=edit&redlink=1 \"John E. Meggitt (page does not exist)\") (IBM[[18]](#cite_note-Meggitt_1962-18)) had proposed as *pseudo-multiplication* and *pseudo-division* in 1961.[[18]](#cite_note-Meggitt_1962-18)[[19]](#cite_note-Cochran_2010_2-19) Meggitt\\'s method also suggested the use of base 10[[18]](#cite_note-Meggitt_1962-18) rather than [base 2](/wiki/Binary_numeral_system \"Binary numeral system\"), as used by Volder\\'s CORDIC so far. These efforts led to the [ROMable](/wiki/ROMable \"ROMable\") logic implementation of a decimal CORDIC prototype machine inside of Hewlett-Packard in 1966,[[20]](#cite_note-Cochran_1966-20)[[19]](#cite_note-Cochran_2010_2-19) built by and conceptually derived from [Thomas E.

This change in the input and output format did not alter CORDIC\\'s core calculation algorithms. CORDIC is particularly well-suited for handheld calculators, in which low cost – and thus low chip gate count – is much more important than speed.\\n\\nCORDIC has been implemented in the [ARM-based](/wiki/ARM_architecture \"ARM architecture\") [STM32G4](/wiki/STM32 \"STM32\"), [Intel 8087](/wiki/Intel_8087 \"Intel 8087\"),[[43]](#cite_note-Muller_2006-43)[[44]](#cite_note-Nave_1983-44)[[45]](#cite_note-Palmer_1984-45)[[46]](#cite_note-Glass_1990-46)[[47]](#cite_note-Jarvis_1990-47) [80287](/wiki/Intel_80287 \"Intel 80287\"),[[47]](#cite_note-Jarvis_1990-47)[[48]](#cite_note-Yuen_1988-48) [80387](/wiki/Intel_80387 \"Intel 80387\")[[47]](#cite_note-Jarvis_1990-47)[[48]](#cite_note-Yuen_1988-48) up to the [80486](/wiki/Intel_80486 \"Intel 80486\")[[43]](#cite_note-Muller_2006-43) coprocessor series as well as in the [Motorola 68881](/wiki/Motorola_68881 \"Motorola 68881\")[[43]](#cite_note-Muller_2006-43)[[44]](#cite_note-Nave_1983-44) and [68882](/wiki/Motorola_68882 \"Motorola 68882\") for some kinds of floating-point instructions, mainly as a way to reduce the gate counts (and complexity) of the [FPU](/wiki/Floating-point_unit \"Floating-point unit\") sub-system.\\n\\n## Applications\\n\\nCORDIC uses simple shift-add operations for several computing tasks such as the calculation of trigonometric, hyperbolic and logarithmic functions, real and complex multiplications, division, square-root calculation, solution of linear systems, [eigenvalue](/wiki/Eigenvalue \"Eigenvalue\") estimation, [singular value decomposition](/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition \"Singular value decomposition\"), [QR factorization](/wiki/QR_factorization \"QR factorization\") and many others. As a consequence, CORDIC has been used for applications in diverse areas such as [signal](/wiki/Signal_processing \"Signal processing\") and [image processing](/wiki/Image_processing \"Image processing\"), [communication systems](/wiki/Communication_systems \"Communication systems\"), [robotics](/wiki/Robotics \"Robotics\") and [3D graphics](/wiki/3D_graphics \"3D graphics\") apart from general scientific and technical computation.[[49]](#cite_note-Meher_2009-49)[[50]](#cite_note-Meher_2013_CORDIC-50)\\n\\n### Hardware\\n\\nThe algorithm was used in the navigational system of the [Apollo program](/wiki/Apollo_program \"Apollo program\")\\'s [Lunar Roving Vehicle](/wiki/Lunar_Roving_Vehicle \"Lunar Roving Vehicle\") to compute [bearing](/wiki/Bearing_(navigation) \"Bearing (navigation)\") and range, or distance from the [Lunar module](/wiki/Lunar_module \"Lunar module\").[[51]](#cite_note-Heffron-LaPiana_1970-51)[[52]](#cite_note-Smith-Mastin_1973-52) CORDIC was used to implement the [Intel 8087](/wiki/Intel_8087 \"Intel 8087\") math coprocessor in 1980, avoiding the need to implement hardware multiplication.[[53]](#cite_note-Shirriff_2020-53)\\n\\nCORDIC is generally faster than other approaches when a hardware multiplier is not available (e.g., a microcontroller), or when the number of gates required to implement the functions it supports should be minimized (e.g., in an FPGA or [ASIC](/wiki/ASIC \"ASIC\")).\\nIn fact, CORDIC is a standard drop-in [IP](/wiki/Semiconductor_intellectual_property_core \"Semiconductor intellectual property core\") in FPGA development applications such as Vivado for Xilinx, while a power series implementation is not due to the specificity of such an IP, i.e. CORDIC can compute many different functions (general purpose) while a hardware multiplier configured to execute power series implementations can only compute the function it was designed for.\\n\\nOn the other hand, when a hardware multiplier is available (*e.g.*, in a [DSP](/wiki/Digital_signal_processing \"Digital signal processing\") microprocessor), table-lookup methods and [power series](/wiki/Power_series \"Power series\") are generally faster than CORDIC. In recent years, the CORDIC algorithm has been used extensively for various biomedical applications, especially in FPGA implementations.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")*]\\n\\nThe [STM32G4](/wiki/STM32#STM32G4 \"STM32\"), [STM32U5](/wiki/STM32#STM32U5 \"STM32\") and [STM32H5](/wiki/STM32#STM32H5 \"STM32\") series and certain [STM32H7](/wiki/STM32#STM32H7 \"STM32\") series of MCUs implement a CORDIC module to accelerate computations in various mixed signal applications such as graphics for [human-machine interface](/wiki/User_interface \"User interface\") and [field oriented control](/wiki/Vector_control_(motor) \"Vector control (motor)\") of motors. While not as fast as a power series approximation, CORDIC is indeed faster than interpolating table based implementations such as the ones provided by the ARM CMSIS and C standard libraries.[[54]](#cite_note-STM_2021-54) Though the results may be slightly less accurate as the CORDIC modules provided only achieve 20 bits of precision in the result. For example, most of the performance difference compared to the ARM implementation is due to the overhead of the interpolation algorithm, which achieves full floating point precision (24 bits) and can likely achieve relative error to that precision.[[55]](#cite_note-ARM_2021-55) Another benefit is that the CORDIC module is a coprocessor and can be run in parallel with other CPU tasks.\\n\\nThe issue with using [Taylor series](/wiki/Taylor_series \"Taylor series\") is that while they do provide small absolute error, they do not exhibit well behaved relative error.[[56]](#cite_note-Error_2021-56) Other means of polynomial approximation, such as [minimax](/wiki/Minimax_approximation_algorithm \"Minimax approximation algorithm\") optimization, may be used to control both kinds of error.\\n\\n### Software\\n\\nMany older systems with integer-only CPUs have implemented CORDIC to varying extents as part of their [IEEE floating-point](/wiki/IEEE_floating-point \"IEEE floating-point\") libraries. As most modern general-purpose CPUs have floating-point registers with common operations such as add, subtract, multiply, divide, sine, cosine, square root, log10, natural log, the need to implement CORDIC in them with software is nearly non-existent. Only microcontroller or special safety and time-constrained software applications would need to consider using CORDIC.\\n\\n## Modes of operation\\n\\n### Rotation mode\\n\\nCORDIC can be used to calculate a number of different functions. This explanation shows how to use CORDIC in *rotation mode* to calculate the sine and cosine of an angle, assuming that the desired angle is given in [radians](/wiki/Radian \"Radian\") and represented in a fixed-point format.

In the examples that follow, note that while the applications are drawn from many different disciplines, the mathematics remains essentially the same. Due to the applied nature of the problems we will examine in this section, we will often express our final answers as decimal approximations (after finding exact answers first, of course!)\\n\\nEquation 5.1\\xa0 Simple Interest\\n\\nThe amount of interest  accrued at an annual rate  on an investment[1]  after  years is\\n\\n\\n\\nThe amount in the account after  years,  is given by\\n\\n\\n\\n5.7.1\\xa0 Applications of Exponential Functions\\n\\nPerhaps the most well-known application of exponential functions comes from the financial world. Suppose you have 100 dollars to invest at your local bank and they are offering a whopping  annual percentage interest rate. This means that after one year, the bank will pay you  of that 100 dollars, or 100(0.05) = 5 dollars in interest, so you now have 105 dollars. This is in accordance with the formula for simple interest\\xa0which you have undoubtedly run across at some point before.\\n\\nSuppose, however, that six months into the year, you hear of a better deal at a rival bank.[2] Naturally, you withdraw your money and try to invest it at the higher rate there. As six months is one half of a year, that initial 100 dollars yields  dollars in interest.\\n\\nYou take your 102.50 dollars off to the competitor and find out that those restrictions which may apply actually  apply, so you return to your bank and re-deposit the 102.50 dollars for the remaining six months of the year.\\n\\nFor the first six months of the year, interest was earned on the original principal of 100 dollars, but for the second six months, interest was earned on 102.50 dollars, that is, you earned interest on your interest. This is the basic concept behind compound interest.\\n\\nIn the previous discussion, we would say that the interest was compounded twice per year, or semiannually.[3] If more money can be earned by earning interest on interest already earned, one wonders what happens if the interest is compounded more often, say every three months – 4 times a year, or `quarterly.’\\n\\nIn this case, the money is in the account for three months, or  of a year, at a time. After the first quarter, we have\\n\\n\\n\\nWe now invest the 101.25 dollars for the next three months and find that at the end of the second quarter, we have\\n\\n\\n\\nContinuing in this manner, the balance at the end of the third quarter is 103.79 dollars, and, at last, we obtain 105.08 dollars. The extra two cents hardly seems worth it, but we see that we do in fact get more money the more often we compound.\\n\\nIn order to develop a formula for this phenomenon, we need to do some abstract calculations. Suppose we wish to invest our principal  at an annual rate  and compound the interest  times per year. This means the money sits in the account  of a year between compoundings. Let  denote the amount in the account after the  compounding.\\n\\nThen  which simplifies to . After the second compounding, we use  as our new principal and get . Continuing in this fashion, we get , , and so on, so that .\\n\\nAs we compound the interest  times per year, after  years, we have  compoundings. We have just derived the general formula for compound interest below.\\n\\nEquation 5.2\\xa0 Compounded Interest\\n\\nIf an initial principal  is invested at an annual rate  and the interest is compounded  times per year, the amount in the account after  years,  is given by\\n\\n\\n\\nIf we take , , and , Equation 5.2 becomes  which reduces to .\\n\\nTo check this new formula against our previous calculations, we find ,  dollars,  dollars, and  dollars.\\n\\nExample 5.7.1\\n\\nExample 5.7.1.1\\n\\nSuppose 2000 dollars is invested in an account which offers  compounded monthly.\\n\\nExpress the amount  in the account as a function of the term of the investment  in years.\\n\\nSolution:\\n\\nExpress the amount  in the account as a function of the term of the investment  in years.\\n\\nSubstituting , , and  (interest is compounded monthly) into Equation 5.2 yields\\n\\n\\n\\nExample 5.7.1.2\\n\\nSuppose 2000 dollars is invested in an account which offers  compounded monthly.\\n\\nHow much is in the account after  years?\\n\\nSolution:\\n\\nHow much is in the account after  years?\\n\\nTo find the amount in the account after  years, we compute\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter  years, we have approximately 2852.92 dollars.\\n\\nExample 5.7.1.3\\n\\nSuppose 2000 dollars is invested in an account which offers  compounded monthly.\\n\\nHow long will it take for the initial investment to double?\\n\\nSolution:\\n\\nHow long will it take for the initial investment to double?\\n\\nOur initial investment is 2000 dollars, so to find the time it takes this to double, we need to find  when . That is, we need to solve\\n\\n\\n\\nTaking natural logs as in Section 5.5, we get .\\n\\nHence, it takes approximately 9 years 9 months for the investment to double.\\n\\nExample 5.7.1.4\\n\\nSuppose 2000 dollars is invested in an account which offers  compounded monthly.\\n\\nCompute and interpret the average rate of change[4] of the amount in the account:\\n\\nSolution:\\n\\nFind and interpret the average rate of change of the amount in the account.\\n\\nRecall to find the average rate of change of  over an interval , we compute .\\n\\nSo, not only is it true that the longer you wait, the more money you have, but also the longer you wait, the faster the money increases.[5]\\n\\nWe have observed that the more times you compound the interest per year, the more money you will earn in a year. Let’s push this notion to the limit.[6]\\n\\nConsider an investment of 1 dollar invested at  interest for  year compounded  times a year.\\xa0 Equation 5.2 tells us that the amount of money in the account after  year is .\\xa0 Below is a table of values relating  and .\\n\\n\\n\\nAs promised, the more compoundings per year, the more money there is in the account, but we also observe that the increase in money is greatly diminishing.\\n\\nWe are witnessing a mathematical `tug of war’. While we are compounding more times per year, and hence getting interest on our interest more often, the amount of time between compoundings is getting smaller and smaller, so there is less time to build up additional interest.\\n\\nWith Calculus, we can show[7] that as , , where  is the natural base first presented in Section 5.2. Taking the number of compoundings per year to infinity results in what is called continuously\\xa0compounded interest.\\n\\nTheorem 5.10\\n\\nInvesting 1 dollar at  interest compounded continuously for one year returns  dollars.\\n\\nUsing this definition of  and a little Calculus, we can take Equation 5.2 and produce a formula for continuously compounded interest.\\n\\nEquation 5.3\\xa0 Continuously Compounded Interest\\n\\nIf an initial principal  is invested at an annual rate  and the interest is compounded continuously, the amount in the account after  years,  is given by\\n\\n\\n\\nIf we take the scenario of Example 5.7.1 and compare monthly compounding to continuous compounding over  years, we find that monthly compounding yields  which is about 24,035.28 dollars, whereas continuously compounding gives  which is about 24,213.18 dollars, a difference of less than .\\n\\nEquations 5.2 and 5.3 both use exponential functions to describe the growth of an investment. It turns out, the same principles which govern compound interest are also used to model short term growth of populations. As with many concepts in this text, these notions are best formalized using the language of Calculus. Nevertheless, we do our best here.\\n\\nIn Biology, The Law of Uninhibited Growth states as its premise that the instantaneous\\xa0 rate at which a population increases at any time is directly proportional to the population at that time.[8]\\xa0 In other words, the more organisms there are at a given moment, the faster they reproduce. Formulating the law as stated results in a differential equation, which requires Calculus to solve. Solving said differential equation gives us the formula below.\\n\\nEquation 5.4 Uninhibited Growth\\n\\nIf a population increases according to The Law of Uninhibited Growth, the number of organisms at time ,  is given by the formula\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere  (read ` nought’) is the initial number of organisms and  is the constant of proportionality which satisfies the equation:\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is worth taking some time to compare Equations 5.3 and 5.4. In Equation 5.3, we use  to denote the initial investment; in Equation 5.4, we use  to denote the initial population. In Equation 5.3,  denotes the annual interest rate, and so it shouldn’t be too surprising that the  in Equation 5.4 corresponds to a growth rate as well. While Equations 5.3 and 5.4 look entirely different, they both represent the same mathematical concept.\\n\\nExample 5.7.2\\n\\nExample 5.7.2\\n\\nIn order to perform arthrosclerosis research, epithelial cells are harvested from discarded umbilical tissue and grown in the laboratory. A technician observes that a culture of twelve thousand cells grows to five million cells in one week. Assuming that the cells follow The Law of Uninhibited Growth, find a formula for the number of cells, in thousands, after  days, .\\n\\nSolution:\\n\\nWe begin with . Recall  gives the number of cells in thousands, so  and .\\n\\nNext, we need to determine the growth rate . We know that after one week, the number of cells has grown to five million. As  measures days and the units of  are in thousands, this translates mathematically to  or .\\n\\nSolving, we get , so .\\n\\nOf course, in practice, we would approximate  to some desired accuracy, say , which we can interpret as an  daily growth rate for the cells.\\n\\nWhereas Equations 5.3 and 5.4 model the growth of quantities, we can use equations like them to describe the decline of quantities.\\n\\nOne example we’ve seen already is Example 5.2.2 in Section 5.2. There, the value of a car decreased from its purchase price of 25,000 dollars to nothing at all.\\n\\nAnother real world phenomenon which follows suit is radioactive decay. There are elements which are unstable and emit energy spontaneously. In doing so, the amount of the element itself diminishes. The assumption behind this model is that the rate of decay of an element at a particular time is directly proportional to the amount of the element present at that time. In other words, the more of the element there is, the faster the element decays.\\n\\nThis is precisely the same kind of hypothesis which drives The Law of Uninhibited Growth, and as such, the equation governing radioactive decay is hauntingly similar to Equation 5.4 with the exception that the rate constant  is negative.\\n\\nEquation 5.5\\xa0 Radioactive Decay\\n\\nThe amount of a radioactive element at time ,  is given by the formula\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere  is the initial amount of the element and  is the constant of proportionality which satisfies the equation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExample 5.7.3\\n\\nExample 5.7.3\\n\\nIodine-131 is a commonly used radioactive isotope and is used to help detect how well the thyroid is functioning. Suppose the decay of Iodine-131 follows the model given in Equation 5.5, and that the half-life[9] of Iodine-131 is approximately  days. If  grams of Iodine-131 is present initially, find a function which gives the amount of Iodine-131, , in grams,  days later.\\n\\nSolution:\\n\\nAs we start with  grams initially, Equation5.5 gives .\\n\\nBecause the half-life is  days, it takes  days for half of the Iodine-131 to decay, leaving half of it behind. Mathematically, this translates to , or\\n\\n\\n\\nwhich we can interpret as a loss of material at a rate of  daily.\\n\\nHence, our final answer is .\\n\\nWe now turn our attention to some more mathematically sophisticated models. One such model is Newton’s Law of Cooling, which we first encountered in Example 5.2.3 of Section 5.2.\\n\\nIn that example we had a cup of coffee cooling from  to room temperature  according to the formula , where  was measured in minutes. In that situation, we knew the physical limit of the temperature of the coffee was room temperature,[10] and the differential equation which gives rise to our formula for  takes this into account.\\n\\nWhereas the radioactive decay model had a rate of decay at time  directly proportional to the amount of the element which remained at time , Newton’s Law of Cooling states that the rate of cooling of the coffee at a given time  is directly proportional to how much of a temperature gap exists between the coffee at time  and room temperature, not the temperature of the coffee itself. In other words, the coffee cools faster when it is first served, and as its temperature nears room temperature, the coffee cools ever more slowly.\\n\\nOf course, if we take an item from the refrigerator and let it sit out in the kitchen, the object’s temperature will rise to room temperature, and as the physics behind warming and cooling is the same, we combine both cases in the equation below.\\n\\nEquation 5.6\\xa0 Newton’s Law of Cooling (Warming)\\n\\nThe temperature of an object at time ,  is given by the formula\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere  is the initial temperature of the object,  is the ambient temperature[11] and  is the constant of proportionality which satisfies the equation\\n\\n\\n\\nIf we re-examine the situation in Example 5.2.3 with , , and , we get, according to Equation 5.6,  which reduces to the original formula given in that example. The rate constant  in this case indicates the coffee is cooling at a rate equal to  of the difference between the temperature of the coffee and its surroundings.\\n\\nNote in Equation 5.6 that the constant  is positive for both the cooling and warming scenarios. What determines if the function  is increasing or decreasing is if  (the initial temperature of the object) is greater than  (the ambient temperature) or vice-versa, as we see in our next example.\\n\\nExample 5.7.4\\n\\nExample 5.7.4.1\\n\\nA roast initially at  cooked in a  oven. After  hours, the temperature of the roast is .\\n\\nAssuming the temperature of the roast follows Newton’s Law of Warming, write a formula for the temperature of the roast  as a function of its time in the oven, , in hours.\\n\\nSolution:\\n\\nAssuming the temperature of the roast follows Newton’s Law of Warming, write a formula for the temperature of the roast  as a function of its time in the oven, , in hours.\\n\\nThe initial temperature of the roast is , so . The environment in which we are placing the roast is the  oven, so . Newton’s Law of Warming gives , or after some simplification, .\\n\\nTo determine , we use the fact that after  hours, the roast is , which means . This gives rise to the equation  which yields .\\n\\nThe temperature function is\\n\\n\\n\\nExample 5.7.4.2\\n\\nA roast initially at  cooked in a  oven. After  hours, the temperature of the roast is .\\n\\nThe roast is done when the internal temperature reaches . When will the roast be done?\\n\\nSolution:\\n\\nThe roast is done when the internal temperature reaches . When will the roast be done?\\n\\nTo find when the roast is done, we set . This gives  whose solution is .\\n\\nHence, the roast is done after roughly  hours and  minutes.\\n\\nIf we had taken the time to graph  in Example 5.7.4, we would have found the horizontal asymptote to be , which corresponds to the temperature of the oven. We can also arrive at this conclusion analytically by applying `number sense’.\\n\\nAs ,  so that . The larger the value of , the smaller  becomes so that , which indicates the graph of  is approaching its horizontal asymptote  from below. Physically, this means the roast will eventually warm up to .\\n\\nThe function  in this situation is sometimes called a limited growth model, because the function  remains bounded as . If we apply the principles behind Newton’s Law of Cooling to a biological example, it says the growth rate of a population is directly proportional to how much room the population has to grow. In other words, the more room for expansion, the faster the growth rate.\\n\\nOur final model, the logistic\\xa0growth model combines The Law of Uninhibited Growth with limited growth and states that the rate of growth of a population varies jointly with the population itself as well as the room the population has to grow.\\n\\nEquation 5.7\\xa0 Logistic Growth\\n\\nIf a population behaves according to the assumptions of logistic growth, the number of organisms at time ,  is given by\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere  is the initial population,  is the limiting population,[12] and  is a measure of how much room there is to grow given by\\n\\n\\n\\nand  is the constant of proportionality which satisfies the equation\\n\\n\\n\\nThe logistic function is used not only to model the growth of organisms, but is also often used to model the spread of disease and rumors.[13]\\n\\nExample 5.7.5\\n\\nExample 5.7.5.1\\n\\nThe number of people , in hundreds, at a local community college who have heard the rumor `Carl’s afraid of Sasquatch’ can be modeled using the logistic equation\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere  is the number of days after April 1, 2016.\\n\\nCompute and interpret .\\n\\nSolution:\\n\\nCompute and interpret .\\n\\nWe find .\\n\\nAs  measures the number of people who have heard the rumor in hundreds,  corresponds to  people.  corresponds to April 1, 2016, thus we may conclude that on that day,  people have heard the rumor.\\n\\nExample 5.7.5.2\\n\\nThe number of people , in hundreds, at a local community college who have heard the rumor `Carl’s afraid of Sasquatch’ can be modeled using the logistic equation\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere  is the number of days after April 1, 2016.\\n\\nWrite and interpret the end behavior of .\\n\\nSolution:\\n\\nWrite and interpret the end behavior of .\\n\\nWe could simply note that  is written in the form of Equation 5.7, and identify . However, to see better why the answer is 84, we proceed analytically.\\n\\nAs the domain of  is restricted to , the only end behavior of significance is . As we’ve seen before,[14] as , we have  and so .\\n\\nHence, as , . This means that as time goes by, the number of people who will have heard the rumor approaches 8400.\\n\\nExample 5.7.5.3\\n\\nThe number of people , in hundreds, at a local community college who have heard the rumor `Carl’s afraid of Sasquatch’ can be modeled using the logistic equation\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere  is the number of days after April 1, 2016.\\n\\nHow long until  people have heard the rumor?\\n\\nSolution:\\n\\nHow long until  people have heard the rumor?\\n\\nTo compute how long it takes until  people have heard the rumor, we set . Solving\\n\\n\\n\\nso it takes around 8 days until 4200 people have heard the rumor.\\n\\nExample 5.7.5.4\\n\\nThe number of people , in hundreds, at a local community college who have heard the rumor `Carl’s afraid of Sasquatch’ can be modeled using the logistic equation\\n\\n\\n\\nwhere  is the number of days after April 1, 2016.\\n\\nCheck your answers to 2 and 3 using technology.\\n\\nSolution:\\n\\nGraphing  below, we see  is the horizontal asymptote of the graph, confirming our answer to number , and the graph intersects the line  at , which confirms our answer to number 3.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf we take the time to analyze the graph of  in Example 5.7.5, we can see graphically\\xa0how logistic growth combines features of uninhibited and limited growth.\\n\\nThe curve is concave up, rising steeply, then at some point, becomes concave down and begins to level off.[15] The point at which this happens is called an inflection point\\xa0or is sometimes called the `point of diminishing returns’. Even though the function is still increasing through the inflection point, the rate at which it does so begins to decrease.\\n\\nWith Calculus, one can show the point of diminishing returns always occurs at half the limiting population. (In our case, when .) So with that in mind, we present two portions of the graph of , one on the interval , the other on . The former looks strikingly like uninhibited growth while the latter like limited growth.\\n\\n\\n\\n5.7.2 Applications of Logarithms\\n\\nJust as many physical phenomena can be modeled by exponential functions, the same is true of logarithmic functions. In Exercises 81, 82, and 83 of Section 5.3, we showed that logarithms are useful in measuring the intensities of earthquakes (the Richter scale), sound (decibels) and acids and bases (pH). We now present yet a different use of the a basic logarithm function, password strength.\\n\\nExample 5.7.6\\n\\nExample 5.7.6.1\\n\\nThe information entropy , in bits, of a randomly generated password consisting of  characters is given by , where  is the number of possible symbols for each character in the password. In general, the higher the entropy, the stronger the password.\\n\\nIf a  character case-sensitive[16] password is comprised of letters and numbers only, find the associated information entropy.\\n\\nSolution:\\n\\nIf a  character case-sensitive password is comprised of letters and numbers only, find the associated information entropy.\\n\\nThere are  letters in the alphabet,  if upper and lower case letters are counted as different. There are  digits ( through ) for a total of  symbols. The password is to be  characters long, so . Thus,\\n\\n\\n\\nExample 5.7.6.2\\n\\nThe information entropy , in bits, of a randomly generated password consisting of  characters is given by , where  is the number of possible symbols for each character in the password. In general, the higher the entropy, the stronger the password.\\n\\nHow many possible symbol options per character is required to produce a 7 character password with an information entropy of 50 bits?\\n\\nSolution:\\n\\nHow many possible symbol options per character is required to produce a  character password with an information entropy of  bits?\\n\\nWe have  and  and we need to find .\\n\\nSolving the equation  gives , so we would need  different symbols to choose from.[17]\\n\\nChemical systems known as buffer solutions have the ability to adjust to small changes in acidity to maintain a range of pH values. Buffer solutions have a wide variety of applications from maintaining a healthy fish tank to regulating the pH levels in blood. Our next example shows how the pH in a buffer solution is a little more complicated than the pH we first encountered in Exercise 83 in Section 5.3.\\n\\nExample 5.7.7\\n\\nExample 5.7.7\\n\\nBlood is a buffer solution. When carbon dioxide is absorbed into the bloodstream it produces carbonic acid and lowers the pH. The body compensates by producing bicarbonate, a weak base to partially neutralize the acid. The equation[18] which models blood pH in this situation is , where  is the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, measured in torr. Find the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood if the pH is 7.4.\\n\\nSolution:\\n\\nWe set  and get\\n\\n\\n\\nHence, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood is about  torr.\\n\\n5.7.3 Section Exercises\\n\\nFor each of the scenarios given in Exercises 1 – 6,\\n\\nIn Exercises 14 – 18, we list some radioactive isotopes and their associated half-lives.

Linear and multiplicative terms are fundamental, representing Ohm's law for ion flow, where current is proportional to conductance and voltage difference (e.g., `g(V-E)`). This accounts for passive leak currents and active ionic currents (e.g., `x_1`, `x_1*x_2`, `x_1*x_3`) [4, 5, 8].\\n\\nPolynomial terms, particularly powers, are essential for modeling voltage-gated ion channels. In the Hodgkin-Huxley model, the opening probabilities of sodium and potassium channels are represented by gating variables raised to powers like `m^3` and `n^4` (e.g., `x_2^3`, `x_3^4`), reflecting multiple independent gates [4, 8]. The FitzHugh-Nagumo model uses a cubic polynomial (`v^3`) to capture the neuron's non-linear voltage dynamics [7, 8].\\n\\nExponential terms (`exp`) are crucial for describing the rapid, sharp onset of action potentials, as seen in the adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire model [4]. They also appear in the voltage-dependent rate functions (alpha and beta) that govern the kinetics of Hodgkin-Huxley gating variables [8]. Other functions like `sqrt` and `log` are not typically found as direct functional terms of the state variables in canonical neuron dynamics, but `log` can appear in the Nernst equation for calculating constant reversal potentials [5]. While a modified FitzHugh-Nagumo model can use `sin` [8], it is not a universally canonical term for intrinsic biophysical dynamics.\\n\\n### Sources\\n[1] Low-dimensional models of single neurons: a review: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37060453/\\n[2] Automatically Selecting a Suitable Integration Scheme for Systems of ...: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6186990/\\n[3] Constructing functional models from biophysically-detailed neurons: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9455888/\\n[4] Biological neuron model - Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_neuron_model\\n[5] PDF: https://opencourse.inf.ed.ac.uk/sites/default/files/https/opencourse.inf.ed.ac.uk/cns/2023/cns3neurons1.pdf\\n[6] PDF: https://diposit.ub.edu/dspace/bitstream/2445/186707/2/tfg_pairo_lopez_alexandra.pdf\\n[7] FitzHugh-Nagumo model - Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FitzHugh%E2%80%93Nagumo_model\\n[8] PDF: https://www.tnstate.edu/mathematics/mathreu/filesreu/Action_Potential_Report.pdf\", 'description': 'This section identifies and explains the most common and physically meaningful functional terms (e.g., powers, exponentials) extracted from established neuron models, detailing their biophysical relevance and why they frequently appear.', 'name': 'Physically Motivated Functional Terms', 'research': True}], 'source_str': 'Search results: \\n\\n\\n\\n--- SOURCE 1: Low-dimensional models of single neurons: a review - PubMed ---\\nURL: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37060453/\\n\\nSUMMARY:\\nAbstract The classical Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) point-neuron model of action potential generation is four-dimensional.

It consists of four ordinary differential equations describing the dynamics of the membrane potential and three gating variables associated to a transient sodium and a delayed-rectifier potassium ionic currents. Conductance-based models of HH type are higher-dimensional extensions of the classical HH model. They include a number of supplementary state variables associated with other ionic current types, and are able to describe additional phenomena such as subthreshold oscillations, mixed-mode oscillations (subthreshold oscillations interspersed with spikes), clustering and bursting. In this manuscript we discuss biophysically plausible and phenomenological reduced models that preserve the biophysical and/or dynamic description of models of HH type and the ability to produce complex phenomena, but the number of effective dimensions (state variables) is lower. We describe several representative models. We also describe systematic and heuristic methods of deriving reduced models from models of HH type.\\n\\n**Keywords:**\\nConductance-based models; Linearized and quadratized models; Model reduction of dimensions; Models of Hodgkin–Huxley type; Models of integrate-and-fire type; Phenomenological reduced models.\\n\\n© 2023.

A multitude of variants has been proposed to cope with the huge diversity of behaviors observed in biological nerve cells. The main appeal of this class of model is that it can be defined in terms of a hybrid model, where a set of mathematical equations describes the sub-threshold dynamics of the membrane potential and the generation of action potentials is often only added algorithmically without the shape of spikes being part of the equations. In contrast to more detailed biophysical models, this simple description of neuron models allows the routine simulation of large biological neuronal networks on standard hardware widely available in most laboratories these days. The time evolution of the relevant state variables is usually defined by a small set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). A small number of evolution schemes for the corresponding systems of ODEs are commonly used for many neuron models, and form the basis of the neuron model implementations built into commonly used simulators like Brian, NEST and NEURON. However, an often neglected problem is that the implemented evolution schemes are only rarely selected through a structured process based on numerical criteria. This practice cannot guarantee accurate and stable solutions for the equations and the actual quality of the solution depends largely on the parametrization of the model. In this article, we give an overview of typical equations and state descriptions for the dynamics of the relevant variables in integrate-and-fire models. We then describe a formal mathematical process to automate the design or selection of a suitable evolution scheme for this large class of models. Finally, we present the reference implementation of our symbolic analysis toolbox for ODEs that can guide modelers during the implementation of custom neuron models.\\n\\n**Keywords:** integrate-and-fire neuron, model dynamics, numerics, integration schemes, ODE, symbolic analysis\\n\\n1. Introduction\\n---------------\\n\\nIn common with all body cells, nerve cells (_neurons_) are delimited by a bi-lipid layer (the _cell membrane_) which is largely impermeable for ions and bigger molecules. Active ion pumps and passive channels embedded into the membrane allow the selective passage of certain ions. Through these transporter molecules, neurons maintain a gradient of different ion types across the membrane, which leads to the _membrane potential_ (Kandel et al., [2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6186990/#B15)).\\n\\nIn the absence of input, the membrane potential fluctuates around the _resting potential_ _E_ L (typically at around −70 mV). Excitatory input depolarizes the membrane, driving the membrane potential closer to zero, while inhibitory input hyperpolarizes the neuron, driving the membrane potential away from zero. If the membrane potential crosses the _spiking threshold_ θ (typically at around −55 mV), the neuron fires an action potential (_spike_), which is transmitted to all downstream (_postsynaptic_) neurons, where it in turn elicits excursions of their membrane potentials.\\n\\nThe basic integrate-and-fire model describes the dynamics of the membrane potential in the following way: the time evolution of the membrane potential _V_ is governed by a differential equation of the type\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nwhere _R_ can be a function of other variables alongside _V_, whose time evolution is described by another ordinary differential equation which can again contain the membrane potential:\\n\\nOnce the membrane potential reaches its threshold θ, a spike is fired and the membrane potential is set back to _E_ L for a certain amount of time called the _refractory period_. After this time the evolution of equation 1 starts again. An important simplification in most models compared to biology is that the exact course of the membrane potential during the spike is either completely neglected or only considered partially. Threshold detection is typically added algorithmically on top of the sub-threshold dynamics.\\n\\nThe two most common variants of this type of model are the _current-based_ and the _conductance-based_ integrate-and-fire model. For the current-based model we have the following general form of the equation:\\n\\n(2)\\n\\nHere _C_ is the _membrane capacitance_, τ the _membrane time constant_ and _I_ the _input current_ to the neuron. If we assume that spikes are constrained to a fixed temporal grid, _I_(_t_) represents the sum of the currents elicited by all incoming spikes at all grid points for times smaller than _t_, plus a piece-wise constant function _I_ ext that models additional external input. _F_, in contrast to the first part of the right-hand-side of equation 2, is some non-linear function of _V_ that may also be zero.\\n\\nFor the conductance-based integrate-and-fire model we have:\\n\\n(3)\\n\\n_G_ has the same form as _I_ but models a conductance rather than a current. _E_ is the _reversal potential_ at which there is no net flow of ions from one side of the membrane to the other (for details see Kandel et al., [2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6186990/#B15)). Equation 3 will usually contain several summands  for differing _G_ _i_ and corresponding _E_ _i_, e.g., for inhibitory and excitatory synaptic conductance. For simplicity we assume only one summand. The differential equations for both the current- and conductance-based models are linear when _F_ ≡ 0. For the current-based model this means that equation 2 is a linear _constant coefficient_ differential equation.\\n\\nAn example of a neuron model described by a system of differential equations, where _F_ ≢ 0 is the _adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire model_:\\n\\nFor the biophysical meaning of the variables _V_ T, δ, _g_, _c_, τ ω and _w_ see the original publication by Brette and Gerstner ([2005](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6186990/#B2)).\\n\\nCurrent-based neuron models with _F_ ≢ 0 are unusual because models from this category are chosen primarily for their simplicity, while conductance-based neuron models are believed to describe neuronal activity in the brain more accurately, albeit at the cost of more complex differential equations.\\n\\nIt should be noted here that although some neuron models are not explicitly referred to or described as _current-based_ or _conductance-based_ models in the literature their time evolution can still be expressed by differential equations of the mathematical forms shown in equations 2 and 3.\\n\\nThe choice of an appropriate solver for a given equation is a non-trivial task, as it requires deep knowledge of ordinary differential equations and numerics to assess the type of differential equation and construct an appropriate numeric solver. This choice depends not only on the form of the differential equation but also on the magnitude of the occurring parameters. For example, Rotter and Diesmann ([1999](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6186990/#B31)) demonstrated that for neuron models that can be expressed as time-invariant linear systems, the analytical solution to the evolution of the dynamics from one time step to the next can be achieved by a matrix multiplication. If applicable, this kind of solution is to be preferred, as it is both exact and computationally efficient.\\n\\nHowever, this approach leaves two key steps up to the modeler: firstly, analyzing the dynamics to discern what category of dynamical system it is; secondly, having performed this analysis, to construct the appropriate solver, e.g., the terms of the propagator matrix for such neurons that can be solved in this way (Rotter and Diesmann, [1999](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6186990/#B31)) or the configuration of an implicit or explicit numeric solver for all other neuron models. As these steps can be quite challenging to many modelers, it would be of great use to have a framework capable of automatically performing this analysis and solver construction.\\n\\nIn section 2 we therefore first derive compact canonical representations of the equations and their parts that allow an efficient implementation on a computer system, and then show that the distinction between current- and conductance-based, linear and non-linear, stiff and non-stiff systems of differential equations is important for automatizing the construction or selection of an optimal evolution scheme.\\n\\nOur reference implementation follows the mathematical observations and is described in section 3. Section 4 demonstrates our application of the framework to some commonly used models in computational neuroscience and explains the integration of the framework into the NEST Modeling Language (NESTML; Plotnikov et al., [2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6186990/#B29)). We close with a presentation of related work in section 5 and a discussion and outlook in section 6, where we summarize possible extensions and further applications of our system.\\n\\n2. Materials and methods\\n------------------------\\n\\nAs already pointed out in the previous section, systems of differential equations describing the dynamics in neuron models can be divided into _current-based_ and _conductance-based_ systems. Additional distinguishing properties are whether the systems are _linear_ or _non-linear, stiff_ or _non-stiff_. We will now describe how these properties influence the choice of an appropriate solver.\\n\\nFor the current-based integrate-and-fire neuron with _F_ ≡ 0, we have a first order constant coefficient linear differential equation where _I_ typically satisfies a homogeneous linear differential equation of some order _n_ ∈ ℕ. Any such ODE or system of ODEs can be solved analytically and efficiently as we will show in section 2.1.\\n\\nWhen evolving systems of ODEs for conductance-based linear or non-linear ODEs, it is necessary to use a numeric integration scheme. Depending on the system at hand, it is advisable to choose either an implicit or an explicit stepping function (section 2.2).\\n\\n### 2.1. Solving linear constant coefficient ODEs analytically\\n\\nFor simplicity we will assume _E_ _L_ in equation 2 to be zero or to be included in one of the other terms of the right hand side. As shown by Rotter and Diesmann ([1999](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6186990/#B31)), if _V_:ℝ → ℝ satisfies the first order constant coefficient linear differential equation\\n\\n(4)\\n\\nwith initial value _V_(0) = _V_ 0, for a function _I_:ℝ+ → ℝ and constants _C_ (the capacitance of the membrane) and τ (the membrane time constant), and if _I_ satisfies\\n\\n(5)\\n\\nfor some _n_ ∈ ℕ and a sequence (_a_ _i_)_i_∈ℕ ⊂ ℝ, an analytical solver can be constructed in the form of a propagator matrix.\\n\\nHere, we show how to evaluate the dynamics to discern whether _V_ and _I_ do indeed satisfy the conditions stated above, and how to derive the evolution scheme for _V_ accordingly. First, we verify that the first order differential equation, , for a right hand side _r_:ℝ × ℝ+ → ℝ, is indeed linear with a constant coefficient, i.e., that  and  is constant. Second we methodically determine whether _I_ satisfies a linear differential equation of some order _n_, i.e., we check whether\\n\\n(6)\\n\\nfor some _a_ 0 ∈ ℝ by solving for _a_ 0. If no such _a_ 0 exists we check whether\\n\\n(7)\\n\\nfor some _a_ 0, _a_ 1 ∈ ℝ using the following procedure: we assume that _a_ 0, _a_ 1 exist such that (7) is satisfied. Then we have for some _t_ 1, _t_ 2 ∈ ℝ (for example _t_ 1 = 1, _t_ 2 = 2):\\n\\nIf det(**X**(_t_ 1, _t_ 2)) ≠ 0 we therefore know that\\n\\nUnder the assumption that (7) is satisfied and that det(**X**(_t_ 1, _t_ 2)) ≠ 0 this gives us _a_ 0 and _a_ 1. If our second assumption is not satisfied we can easily chose _t_ 1 and _t_ 2 so that it is. We can now determine whether the first assumption is correct by inserting the calculated values for _a_ 0 and _a_ 1 and checking if the following equation is true:\\n\\n(8)\\n\\nNow, if such _a_ 0 and _a_ 1 exist, they are unique, as _I_ and  are linearly independent, since there was no _a_ 0 ∈ ℝ such that (6) was satisfied. If _a_ 0 and _a_ 1 do not satisfy (8), we check methodically if constants (_a_ _i_)_i_∈ℕ ⊂ ℝ exist, for which (5) is satisfied for _n_ = 3, 4, …. Again we assume that _a_ 0, …, _a_ _n_ ∈ ℝ exist such that (5) is satisfied. Then we have for  (for example _t_ 1 = 1, …, _t_ _n_ = _n_):\\n\\n(9)\\n\\n(10)\\n\\nIf det(**X**(_t_)) ≠ 0 we get\\n\\n(11)\\n\\nAgain, if det(**X**(_t_)) = 0 we simply use another _t_, for example _t_ = (_t_ 1 + 1, …, _t_ _n_ + 1). Then we obtain the values of _a_ 0, …, _a_ _n_ under the assumption that (5) is satisfied for order _n_. We check whether the assumption in (5) is true by symbolically evaluating whether\\n\\nIf (5) is not satisfied we go on to check\\n\\nfor some _a_ 0, …, _a_ _n_+1, and so on. This way, for every _I_ that satisfies (5) for order _n_ we can determine the factors _a_ 0, …, _a_ _n_. Then we can rephrase (4) as the _homogeneous_ differential equation\\n\\n(12)\\n\\nwith initial values **y**(0) = **y**0,  and\\n\\n(13)\\n\\nThus for _n_ = 1 we have\\n\\nand for _n_ = 2 we have\\n\\nAs it can be both more convenient and computationally more efficient when **A** is a _lower triangular_ matrix we give an alternative choice of **A** and **y**, where **A** is a triangular matrix:\\n\\n(14)\\n\\nwhere\\n\\n(15)\\n\\nand\\n\\n(16)\\n\\nThen we can determine the solution **y** at _t_ ∈ ℝ+ using the matrix exponential:\\n\\n(17)\\n\\nWe can rephrase this to obtain an incremental formulation which allows the evolution of the system by a single calculation of _e_**A**_h_ for a fixed step size _h_ ∈ ℝ+:\\n\\nIt is important to note here that the exact integration of (2) depends on the exact calculation of _e_**A**_h_. Let _I_(_t_) be the sum of currents elicited by all incoming spikes at all grid points for times _t_ _i_ ≤ _t_,\\n\\nwhere , for _t_ ∈ ℝ+.  is the _synaptic weight_ of synapse _k_ and ι satisfies the differential equation 5 on ℝ+ for some constants (_a_ _i_)_i_ ∈ ℕ ⊂ ℝ and some _n_ ∈ ℕ. Then _I_ satisfies the differential equation 5 on . Therefore we can consider _I_ as the solution of the differential equation 5 on the intervals (0, _t_ 1), (_t_ 1, _t_ 2), … with suitable initial values. For _t_ ∈ (_t_ _i_−1, _t_ _i_) we can calculate\\n\\nAt time _t_ _i_, for _i_ ∈ ℕ, the differential equation 5 is not satisfied because ι does not satisfy the equation at _t_ = 0, but we get _I_(_t_ _i_) by continuous continuation to the boundary of the interval (_t, t_ _i_). The derivatives of _I_ contained in **y** must be updated by initial values of additional spikes at time _t_ _i_, meaning for **P**(_h_) = _e_**A**_h_\\n\\nwhere\\n\\nHere **T** ∈ ℝ _n_+1 × ℝ _n_+1 is such that\\n\\n**T** is the identity matrix when **y** is chosen as the vector of derivatives as in equations 12 and 13 but it may well be non-trivial, e.g., when **y** is chosen as in equation 16.\\n\\nNow we know an analytical and efficient way to evolve any linear constant coefficient ODE containing the convolution of the solution of a linear homogeneous ODE and a weighted spike train.\\n\\n#### 2.1.1. Adding a constant external input current\\n\\nA common requirement in neuroscientific modeling is to add a bias current to neurons. We will now show how to solve the differential equation when we have an additional constant external input current _I_ E:\\n\\nAs shown above, we can solve\\n\\n(18)\\n\\nConsider the following differential equation,\\n\\n(19)\\n\\nwhere τ, _C_ and _I_ E are constants. By _variation of constants_ (Walter, [2000](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6186990/#B41)) we have a solution of (19):\\n\\nNow we know solutions _V_ 1 and _V_ 2 of (18) and (19). Therefore _V_: = _V_ 1 + _V_ 2 solves\\n\\nand for **P**: **P**(_h_) = _e_**A**_h_ the following holds\\n\\nAs the last column _a_ in **A** has only one entry  and ,\\n\\nWe get:\\n\\nThis method is also applicable when we have a piece-wise constant function  instead of a constant _I_ E:\\n\\nwhere for all _i_ ∈ ℕ there is a _c_ _i_ ∈ ℝ such that  for all _t_ ∈ [_t_ _i_, _t_ _i_ + _h_). We rephrase the problem as:\\n\\non _t_ ∈ [_t_ _i_, _t_ _i_ + _h_) for all _i_ ∈ ℕ and get\\n\\nand\\n\\nNow we have an exact description for how to handle the evolution of linear constant coefficient ODEs containing the convolution of the solution of a linear homogeneous ODE and a weighted spike train with an additional constant external input, that is still analytical and efficient.\\n\\n#### 2.1.2. Handling sums\\n\\nThe approximation of postsynaptic currents observed in real brain experiments is sometimes best modeled by different functions for different synapses. We can handle the case when _I_ is the sum of functions _I_ 1, _I_ 2 which satisfy a homogeneous differential equation of arbitrary order _m_ and _n_ in the following way. As seen above if _V_ 1 is a solution of\\n\\nand _V_ 2 is a solution of\\n\\nthen _V_ = _V_ 1 + _V_ 2 is a solution of\\n\\nIf, furthermore, _I_ 1 satisfies (5) for _n_ ∈ ℕ\\n\\nwhere **P**1 is the corresponding propagator matrix and _I_ 2 satisfies (5) for some _m_ ∈ ℕ\\n\\nwhere **P**2 is the corresponding propagator matrix, then\\n\\nTherefore we just need to compute two propagator matrices to handle the sum.\\n\\n### 2.2. Choice of a suitable numeric integration scheme\\n\\n_Explicit methods_ for solving differential equations are methods that only use already known values of the function at earlier grid points to determine the value at the next grid point. The efficiency and accuracy of explicit methods is typically sufficient for systems of ODEs used to model neuronal behavior. Popular examples of such methods are the explicit 4th order classical Runge-Kutta or the explicit embedded Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method (Dahmen and Reusken, [2005](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6186990/#B5)) for the approximative solution of ODEs. Most neuron model implementations currently use explicit stepping algorithms and still achieve satisfactory results in terms of accuracy and simulation time (Morrison et al., [2007](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6186990/#B25); Hanuschkin et al., [2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6186990/#B12)). However, some published models involve possibly _stiff_ differential equations (e.g., Brette and Gerstner, [2005](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6186990/#B2)), which potentially require a different class of solvers.\\n\\nLambert ([1992](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6186990/#B21)) defines stiffness as follows:\\n\\n> If a numerical method […] applied to a system with any initial conditions, is forced to use in a certain interval of integration a steplength which is excessively small in relation to the smoothness of the exact solution in that interval, then the system is said to be stiff in that interval.\\n\\nA typical case of stiffness is for example, when different parts of the solution of a system of equations decays on different time scales.\\n\\nThis usually comes from very different scales inherent to the ODE. These scales will reflect in the parameters of the equations, i.e., the range of constants occurring in the equations of the systems. Therefore the stiffness of a system always depends not only on the mathematical form of the equations but heavily on the magnitude of the constants occurring in them.\\n\\nIn principle it is possible to solve stiff equations with explicit methods, but this comes at the expense of a very small step size when using an adaptive step size algorithm and trying to achieve a certain accuracy. This in turn leads to high computational costs. For non-adaptive step size algorithms it leads to plain wrong results without the user knowing, since the algorithm still terminates, but with large error. Moreover, as the limited machine precision on a digital computer constitutes a lower bound for the step size, explicit methods usually become unstable when applied to stiff problems.\\n\\n_Implicit methods_, on the other hand, do not use previous values to calculate the solution at the next grid point, but only employ them implicitly in the form of the solution of a system of equations. This makes implicit methods computationally much more costly, but usually allows a larger step size to be chosen, thus avoiding stability problems (Strehmel and Weiner, [1995](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6186990/#B37)).\\n\\nIn order to detect whether an explicit or implicit method is better suited for a given ODE we devise the following testing strategy.\\n\\nFirst, we choose representative spike trains (drawn from a Poisson distribution) and compute approximate solutions for the given system of ODEs using an explicit and implicit method of the same order:\\n\\n1.   an explicit 4th order Runge-Kutta method\\n\\n2.   an implicit Bulirsch-Stoer method of Bader and Deuflhard (Strehmel and Weiner, [1995](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6186990/#B37))\\n\\nboth with adaptive step size. We can then compare them with respect to the required _average step size_ and _minimal step size_. In cases where the implicit method performs better than the explicit method, we have reason to believe that the ODE is stiff and that the use of an implicit method is advisable.\\n\\nAlthough ODEs may be stiff only for very specific initial conditions, usually stiffness should be observable for a wide range of initial values, or in this case for a number of incoming spike trains (Strehmel and Weiner, [1995](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6186990/#B37)). By choosing many spike trains, evaluating the required step sizes for the implicit and explicit method for each of them, and comparing that to the machine precision ε, it is thus possible to detect whether the problem at hand is stiff or not. We propose the following rules for choosing an implicit algorithm:\\n\\n*   if the minimal step size of runs using the explicit method is close to machine precision (i.e., less than 10·ε) and this is not the case for the minimal step size of runs using the implicit method (i.e., greater than or equal to 10·ε) this is a hint that the system of ODEs is possibly stiff. In this case an explicit stepping function could become unstable or even abort, so we suggest the use of an implicit algorithm.\\n\\n*   if the minimal step size of runs using the explicit method is reasonably large (i.e., greater than or equal to 10·ε) we have to test two cases:\\n\\n    *   – if the minimal step size of runs of the implicit method is very small (i.e., less than 10·ε), we suggest using an explicit method.\\n\\n    *   – if the minimal step size of runs of the implicit method is large (i.e., greater than or equal to 10·ε), we go on to check if the average step size of runs using the implicit algorithm is much larger than the average step size of runs using the explicit algorithm. If this is the case, this again indicates that the system of ODEs is stiff and therefore c\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n--- SOURCE 3: Constructing functional models from biophysically-detailed neurons ---\\nURL: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9455888/\\n\\nSUMMARY:\\nOther models, such as SPAUN [3], use neural networks to realize cognitive systems and perform tasks end-to-end, but have limited biological realism: while they respect the anatomical connectivity between brain structures and recreate their proposed functions, many of their low-level mechanisms, such as the neuron and synapse models, are crude approximations of the brain’s biological substrate.

We develop a method called “oracle-supervised Neural Engineering Framework” (osNEF) to train biologically-detailed spiking neural networks that realize a variety of cognitively-relevant dynamical systems. Specifically, we train networks to perform computations that are commonly found in cognitive systems (communication, multiplication, harmonic oscillation, and gated working memory) using four distinct neuron models (leaky-integrate-and-fire neurons, Izhikevich neurons, 4-dimensional nonlinear point neurons, and 4-compartment, 6-ion-channel layer-V pyramidal cell reconstructions) connected with various synaptic models (current-based synapses, conductance-based synapses, and voltage-gated synapses). We show that osNEF networks exhibit the target dynamics by accounting for nonlinearities present within the neuron models: performance is comparable across all four systems and all four neuron models, with variance proportional to task and neuron model complexity. We also apply osNEF to build a model of working memory that performs a delayed response task using a combination of pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons connected with NMDA and GABA synapses. The baseline performance and forgetting rate of the model are consistent with animal data from delayed match-to-sample tasks (DMTST): we observe a baseline performance of 95% and exponential forgetting with time constant _τ_ = 8.5s, while a recent meta-analysis of DMTST performance across species observed baseline performances of 58 − 99% and exponential forgetting with time constants of _τ_ = 2.4 − 71s. These results demonstrate that osNEF can train functional brain models using biologically-detailed components and open new avenues for investigating the relationship between biophysical mechanisms and functional capabilities.\\n\\nAuthor summary\\n--------------\\n\\nComputational models of biologically realistic neural networks help scientists understand and recreate a wide variety of brain processes, responsible for everything from fish locomotion to human cognition. To be useful, these models must both recreate features of the brain, such as the electrical, chemical, and geometric properties of neurons, and perform useful functional operations, such as storing and retrieving information from a short term memory. Here, we develop a new method for training networks built from biologically detailed components. We simulate networks that contain a variety of complex neurons and synapses, then show that our method successfully trains them to perform a variety of cognitive operations. Most notably, we train a working memory model that contains detailed reconstructions of cortical neurons, and demonstrate that it performs a memory task with performance that is comparable to simple animals. Researchers can use our method to train detailed brain models and investigate how biological features (or deficits thereof) relate to cognition, which may provide insights into the biological basis of mental disorders such as Parkinson’s disease.\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n--------------\\n\\nBiological detail is an important concern for neural models that seek to bridge the gap between neural and cognitive processes. The inclusion of synaptic and cellular mechanisms in cognitive models allows researchers to investigate aspects of psychology, such as biologically-grounded mental disorders and their pharmacological treatment, that often cannot be studied with simpler models. Biological features, such as neural nonlinearities and local connectivity, have historically inspired innovations in artificial intelligence, including convolutional networks and long-short-term-memory units. Unfortunately, simulating biological detail often increases the difficulty of building and analyzing cognitive models. To mitigate these difficulties, most models compromise on either biological realism, such as ion-channel dynamics or synaptic connectivity, or cognitive capacity, defined as the ability to perform computationally-useful operations on inputs and produce task-relevant behavioral outputs. For example, cognitive architectures like ACT-R [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9455888/#pcbi.1010461.ref001)] have produced numerous models of human cognition that closely match behavioral data, but which use production rules and activation functions that coarsely approximate the brain’s neural substrate, limiting their ability to investigate many neurocognitive phenomenon. At the opposite extreme, the Human Brain Project [[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9455888/#pcbi.1010461.ref002)] has produced models that recreate the anatomy and spiking behavior of entire cortical microcircuits, but these models do not perform recognizable neural computations or produce behavior, limiting their utility for investigating cognitive phenomenon. Other models, such as SPAUN [[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9455888/#pcbi.1010461.ref003)], use neural networks to realize cognitive systems and perform tasks end-to-end, but have limited biological realism: while they respect the anatomical connectivity between brain structures and recreate their proposed functions, many of their low-level mechanisms, such as the neuron and synapse models, are crude approximations of the brain’s biological substrate. To study the biological foundations of the human brain and design biologically-inspired cognitive algorithms, models which unify biophysical detail and cognitive capacity are needed.\\n\\nSeveral existing frameworks leverage biological neural networks to perform cognitive tasks. The Neural Engineering Framework (NEF) and the Semantic Pointer Architecture [[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9455888/#pcbi.1010461.ref004), [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9455888/#pcbi.1010461.ref005)] use large-scale, biologically-constrained spiking neural networks to study the functional aspects of cognition. Similarly, the Leabra cognitive architecture [[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9455888/#pcbi.1010461.ref006)] uses biologically-plausible learning rules to capture the functionality of major cognitive systems. Other approaches emphasize dynamics within neural networks, which, when properly controlled, can be used to perform mathematical transformations of represented information and issue behavioral commands. The efficient coding hypothesis [[7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9455888/#pcbi.1010461.ref007)] uses cortical connectivity to produce controlled spiking networks, while FORCE [[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9455888/#pcbi.1010461.ref008)] uses online learning rules in recurrent networks to implement dynamical systems. While each of these frameworks emphasizes the role of particular biological features (such as spiking neurons, learning rules, or constrained connectivity) for cognition, little attention has been paid to the complexity of individual neurons, the fundamental unit in most intelligent systems. For the most part, these architectures assume simple models for neurons, ranging from rate-mode neural assemblies to point neurons like the leaky-integrate-and-fire model.\\n\\nThis raises the question: how important are the biological details of individual cells for cognitive systems? It is certainly true that that some cellular features, such as cellular respiration, have little bearing on information processing, while others, like dendritic structure and calcium dynamics, play a larger role. Computational models are an essential tool when investigating the contribution of these cellular mechanisms: they allow researchers to systematically vary the network’s biological complexity while examining changes in cognitive performance. At a minimum, experimentation with such models would show that specific biological features do not affect a network’s functional capabilities: this result would justify the exclusion of these features for future research, validating the current paradigm of simple, easy-to-simulate neuron models. On the other hand, experimentation may reveal that existing architectures do not function properly when cellular complexity is reintroduced, which would suggest that theoretical improvements are needed to explain how brains accommodate this complexity. Modellers may even find that adding biological complexity increases the computational power or cognitive flexibility of the network, for example through dendritic filtering or neurotransmitter-dependent spike modulation.\\n\\nIn this paper, we propose a method for training and simulating networks that contain biologically detailed neuron models and perform useful cognitive operations. We label this method “oracle-supervised Neural Engineering Framework” (osNEF): it is an extension of core NEF principles that utilizes an “oracle”, a parallel network that is used during training to supervise the learning process. One major advantage of osNEF is that it treats the neuron model as a “black box”, relying on learning rules that only consider the spiking inputs and outputs to each cell. Because it does not rely on detailed knowledge of cellular dynamics, osNEF can be applied to a wide range of neuron models without major changes to the algorithm. To facilitate easy adoption of osNEF, we develop an interface where modellers may plug in existing neuron models, written in Python or NEURON, to the general-purpose Nengo simulator [[9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9455888/#pcbi.1010461.ref009)], which facilitates large-scale functional modelling. This approach lets modellers specify detailed low-level mechanisms like conductance-based synapses, voltage-gated ion channels, and dendritic geometry, then train the network to realize high-level dynamics or computations. Our goal is to show that osNEF can be used to construct a variety of functional neural networks from various biologically detailed components, allowing researchers to investigate questions that relate low-level biological details (e.g. calcium dynamics) to high-level cognitive capacity (e.g., task performance).\\n\\nTo demonstrate these capabilities, we apply osNEF to produce two classes of cognitive functionality. First, we highlight the broad applicability of osNEF by simulating networks of biologically detailed neurons and training them to implement specific dynamics. We assume that some low-dimensional state space is represented by heterogeneous spiking activity within the network, then show that synaptic transmission between groups of detailed neurons may realize specific mathematical operations on that state space, notably addition, multiplication, oscillation, and integration. These operations were chosen because they represent computational primitives that are widely used in cognitive systems. We simulate four different neuron models, ranging in complexity from a LIF point neuron to a spatially-extended pyramidal cell, and show that osNEF can accommodate them all to realize the target operations. Second, to demonstrate a concrete cognitive application, we construct a biologically-detailed model of working memory in PFC that performs an idealized memory task. The network is composed of anatomically-detailed reconstructions of layer-V pyramidal cells and fast-spiking interneurons; both neuron models contain numerous geometric compartments and ionic currents and are connected using conductance-based NMDA and GABA synapses. We show that the mnemonic performance of the model is consistent with empirical data from a standard test of working memory, the delayed match-to-sample task (DMTST): both simulated and empirical data are well-characterized by an exponential forgetting curve (_y_(_t_) = _B_ exp(−_t_/_τ_)) with baseline performance _B_ = 80 − 100% and forgetting time constant _τ_ = 10 − 60s. We conclude with a discussion of the strengths and limitations of osNEF, including its biological plausibility and cognitive generality, and by comparing it to similar approaches.\\n\\n2 Background\\n------------\\n\\nAs in the NEF and SPA, we characterize spiking activity within populations of neurons as encoding information in a latent _state space_. While spikes are the physical means of communication between neurons, cognition can be analyzed (to a large degree) as transformations of these lower-dimensional states, permitting a more abstract, computational, or symbol-like description of what brains do. We assume that this state space can be represented by a vector-valued signal **x**(_t_), and that the cognitive operations performed in the brain may be described through the dynamics of this state space . At the sensory periphery, neurons transduce external signals (light, sound, etc.) into spikes which represent the stimuli. This representation is somehow transformed via connections within the brain, ultimately producing motor commands that activate the body’s muscles. Because we are chiefly concerned with cognitive processes, we will also treat sensory inputs and motor commands as state space signals, and focus primarily on how spiking activity and neural connections represent and transform **x**(_t_) within the brain.\\n\\nBroadly speaking, our goal is to describe cognitive processing in terms of state space dynamics, then train the connectivity within a neural network such that its spiking activity implements those dynamics. As in the NEF, we first define encoding and decoding between neural activity and the state space, then later describe how synaptic connections implement state space transformations. Given a signal **x**(_t_) and a population of neurons, the signal must drive those neurons to fire in patterns that represent the signal. Each neuron spikes most frequently when presented with its particular “preferred stimulus” and responds less strongly to increasingly dissimilar stimuli (i.e., values of **x**(_t_)). Each neuron _i_ is accordingly assigned a preferred direction vector, or _encoder_, **e**_i_. At the sensory periphery, **e**_i_ determines how the external **x**(_t_) is transduced into electrical inputs to neuron _i_; within the network itself, **e**_i_ co-determines connection weights, which dictate how neuron _i_ responds to spiking inputs from an upstream population whose activities represent **x**(_t_). Mathematically, both these processes can be summarized as\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nwhere _J_ _i_(_t_) is the electrical current driving neuron _i_, and **e**_i_ ⋅ **x**(_t_) is the dot product between the state space input and neuron _i_’s encoder. This current drives the neuron model,\\n\\n(2)\\n\\nwhere _a_ _i_(_t_) is the spiking activity, _G_ is the neuron model, and _β_ _i_ is an optional bias current. The specifics of how inputs drive the cell, and how the cell dynamically responds, vary across neuron models _G_, as discussed below. A distributed encoding extends this notion: if **x**(_t_) is fed into multiple neurons, each with a unique tuning curve defined by **e**_i_ and other parameters, then each neuron will respond with a unique spiking pattern _a_ _i_(_t_), and the collection of all neural activities will robustly encode the signal.\\n\\nFor state space representation to be useful, there must be methods to recover, or decode, the original vector from the neuron activities. We identify _decoders_**d**_i_ that either perform this recovery or compute arbitrary functions, _f_(**x**), of the represented vector. A functional decoding with  allows networks of neurons to _transform_ the signal into a new state, which is essential for performing cognitive operations. To compute these transformations, a linear decoding is applied to the neural activities:\\n\\n(3)\\n\\nwhere _a_ _i_ is the activity of neuron _i_, _n_ is the number of neurons, and the hat notation indicates that the computed quantity is an estimate of the target function. Neural activity _a_ is obtained by convolving spike trains with a smoothing filter _h_:\\n\\n(4)\\n\\nwhere _T_ are the spike times, _h_ is an impulse response function for the filter, (*) is convolution, and _δ_ _i_ is a Dirac delta function describing the spike train for neuron _i_. To maintain correspondence with biology, we use these same filters _h_ when implementing synapses within the network (see Sec 3.3); we therefore typically refer to _h_ as the “synaptic” filter.\\n\\nAt the motor periphery, **x**(_t_) is retrieved using appropriate decoders, driving the model’s behavioral output; within the network itself,  co-determines connection weights, which dictate how downstream neurons respond to spikes produced by neuron _i_. Connection _weights_ between each presynaptic neuron _i_ and each postsynaptic neuron _j_ combine encoders and decoders into a single value: the weight matrix **w** is the cross product between the encoder and decoder matrices,\\n\\n(5)\\n\\nOur primary tool for studying state space transformations is control theory, which specifies the dynamics of **x**(_t_) as\\n\\n(6)\\n\\nwhere  is the derivative of the represented state, **u**(_t_) are inputs (external signals or upstream representations), and _A_ and _B_ are the transformation matrices. _B_ governs how feedforward inputs affect the current representation (e.g., scaled addition), while _A_ governs how recurrent inputs affect the representation (e.g., simple harmonic oscillation); both _A_ and _B_ are implemented through weighted synaptic connections between neurons in populations representing **u**(_t_) and **x**(_t_). In this work we restrict ourselves to linear dynamical systems; while the theory and mathematical assumptions of the NEF and osNEF do not confine these frameworks to linear systems, demonstrating that osNEF can successfully realize the wider (and more difficult) class of nonlinear systems is a significant extra challenge that we leave for future work.\\n\\nGiven this framework, which is a direct recapitulation of the NEF [[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9455888/#pcbi.1010461.ref004)], the challenge of building cognitive neural systems reduces to (a) describing a cognitive algorithm as a dynamical system (e.g., [Eq 6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9455888/#pcbi.1010461.e009)), and (b) finding encoders and decoders such that neural connection weights implement the transformations dictated by the dynamical system. In addition, learning rules based on error-driven feedback or supervision may be used to train the weights through encoder and/or decoder updates, in which case the resulting cognitive algorithm may be estimated once learning is complete. The framework is therefore consistent with either a top-down or bottom-up approach to neural modelling, and our method combines both approaches when learning the parameters of synaptic connections.\\n\\n3 Methods\\n---------\\n\\nWe now summarize the osNEF, which extends the core NEF by introducing new methods for training neural networks, and describe the neuron models we tested; all code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/psipeter/functional-detailed-neurons).\\n\\n### 3.1 Tuning curves\\n\\nWe begin by describing a target _tuning curve_ which relates a neuron’s input **x** to its spiking activity _a_. This tuning curve should include a nonlinearity so that networks of neurons with such tuning may compute interesting functions on state space inputs. Many target tuning curves are possible: we seek one that is both easily parameterized and biologically plausible: that is, its shape should be described by a few intuitive parameters, and it should qualitatively match in-vivo elecrophysiology. While many choices are possible, we define our tuning curve using a linear map (defined by encoders and biases, Eqs [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9455888/#pcbi.1010461.e002) and [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9455888/#pcbi.1010461.e003)) and a rectified linear unit (ReLU). The ReLU neuron is parameterized by an x-intercept (the value of the input current below which a neuron stops firing) and a y-intercept (the neural activity when the input is at its extrema).\\n\\nWe use ReLUs as our target tuning curves for three reasons. First, ReLUs are (arguably) the simplest spiking neurons that still capture an essential neural nonlinearity: the transition from a region (in state space) where the neuron remains (mostly) inactive, to a region where activity increases monotonically (as state inputs change). Second, networks of ReLUs are cheap to simulate but functionally powerful: deep neural networks populated with ReLUs can be trained to perform a wide variety of complex tasks [[10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9455888/#pcbi.1010461.ref010)]. Third, ReLU parameters are intuitively aligned with the standard NEF technique for generating tuning curve _distributions_. A population of neurons representing a state space input should be sensitive to the whole range of **x**, otherwise parts of the state space will have low signal-to-noise ratios and the accuracy of the computation will suffer. We must therefore also choose a distribution of target tuning curves that adequately covers **x**. Previous works have extensively studied how different distributions may effectively represent a state space and dynamically compute functions [[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9455888/#pcbi.1010461.ref004), [11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9455888/#pcbi.1010461.ref011)]. One effective distribution is shown in [Fig 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9455888/#pcbi.1010461.g001): these tuning curves have x-intercepts that vary uniformally across the state space, meaning they are inactive for some values of **x** and otherwise have state-dependent activity; and they have y-intercepts (maximum firing rates) that vary uniformally over some range, meaning their spike rates change by different amounts per unit change in **x**. The combination of these constraints makes it easy to accurately decode an estimate  from the collection of neural activities, and, with ReLU neurons, it is easy to set neural parameters to achieve these constraints.\\n\\n#### Fig 1. Target tuning curve distribution.\\n\\n[![Image 9: Fig 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/7265/9455888/a31e45554a0e/pcbi.1010461.g001.jpg)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&p=PMC3&id=9455888_pcbi.1010461.g001.jpg)\\n\\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9455888/figure/pcbi.1010461.g001/)\\n\\nAn example of the distribution of responses for 100 ReLU neurons with x-intercepts in -[1, 1] and y-intercepts in [20, 40].\\n\\nIn contrast to these benefits, the ReLU response function is a poor fit for most electrophysiological data. Notably, as inputs increase, ReLU firing rates increase linearly without bounds, while the activity of biological neurons are constrained to some maximum value, such that firing rates will plateau as neural activity approaches this value. In Sec 4.1, we explore the degree to which biologically implausible target tuning curves affect osNEF’s ability to train networks of detailed neurons.\\n\\n### 3.2 Online learning rules for encoders and decoders\\n\\nGiven a set of target tuning curves, our first goal is to train synaptic parameters such that, when a population of complex neuron models is simulated within a network, the observed spike rates resemble the rates given by the target tuning curves. The network and procedure used to train these parameters is depicted in [Fig 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9455888/#pcbi.1010461.g002) and summarized in [Table 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9455888/#pcbi.1010461.t001). We begin with an input signal **x**(_t_) that is fed into two streams.

The most significant disadvantage of this model is that it does not contain neuronal adaptation, so that it cannot describe an experimentally measured spike train in response to constant input current. Again, the spike response model or the adaptive integrate-and-fire model enables to prediction of the spike train in the output for arbitrary time-dependent input, whereas an artificial neuron or a simple leaky integrate-and-fire does not.\\n\\nFULL CONTENT:\\n![](/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png)\\n![Wikipedia](/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg)\\n![The Free Encyclopedia](/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg)\\n\\n## Contents\\n\\n# Biological neuron model\\n\\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | **This article has multiple issues.** Please help **[improve it](/wiki/Special:EditPage/Biological_neuron_model \"Special:EditPage/Biological neuron model\")** or discuss these issues on the **[talk page](/wiki/Talk:Biological_neuron_model \"Talk:Biological neuron model\")**. *([Learn how and when to remove these messages](/wiki/Help:Maintenance_template_removal \"Help:Maintenance template removal\"))* |  |  | | --- | --- | |  | This article\\'s **tone or style may not reflect the [encyclopedic tone](/wiki/Wikipedia:Writing_better_articles#Tone \"Wikipedia:Writing better articles\") used on Wikipedia**.

Neurons (or nerve cells) are [electrically excitable](/wiki/Membrane_potential \"Membrane potential\") cells within the [nervous system](/wiki/Nervous_system \"Nervous system\"), able to fire electric signals, called [action potentials](/wiki/Action_potentials \"Action potentials\"), across a [neural network.](/wiki/Neural_network_(biology) \"Neural network (biology)\") These mathematical models describe the role of the biophysical and geometrical characteristics of neurons on the conduction of electrical activity.\\n\\nCentral to these models is the description of how the [membrane potential](/wiki/Membrane_potential \"Membrane potential\") (that is, the difference in [electric potential](/wiki/Electric_potential \"Electric potential\") between the interior and the exterior of a biological [cell](/wiki/Cell_(biology) \"Cell (biology)\")) across the [cell membrane](/wiki/Cell_membrane \"Cell membrane\") changes over time. In an experimental setting, stimulating neurons with an electrical current generates an [action potential](/wiki/Action_potential \"Action potential\") (or spike), that propagates down the neuron\\'s [axon](/wiki/Axon \"Axon\"). This axon can branch out and connect to a large number of downstream neurons at sites called [synapses](/wiki/Synapse \"Synapse\"). At these synapses, the spike can cause the release of [neurotransmitters](/wiki/Neurotransmitter \"Neurotransmitter\"), which in turn can change the voltage potential of downstream neurons. This change can potentially lead to even more spikes in those downstream neurons, thus passing down the signal. As many as 95% of neurons in the [neocortex](/wiki/Neocortex \"Neocortex\"), the outermost layer of the [mammalian](/wiki/Mammal \"Mammal\") [brain](/wiki/Brain \"Brain\"), consist of excitatory [pyramidal neurons](/wiki/Pyramidal_cell \"Pyramidal cell\"),[[2]](#cite_note-2)[[3]](#cite_note-3) and each pyramidal neuron receives tens of thousands of inputs from other neurons.[[4]](#cite_note-4) Thus, spiking neurons are a major information processing unit of the [nervous system](/wiki/Nervous_system \"Nervous system\").\\n\\nOne such example of a spiking neuron model may be a highly detailed mathematical model that includes spatial [morphology](/wiki/Morphology_(biology) \"Morphology (biology)\"). Another may be a conductance-based neuron model that views neurons as points and describes the membrane voltage dynamics as a function of trans-membrane currents. A mathematically simpler \"integrate-and-fire\" model significantly simplifies the description of [ion channel](/wiki/Ion_channel \"Ion channel\") and membrane potential dynamics (initially studied by Lapique in 1907).[[5]](#cite_note-5)[[6]](#cite_note-6)\\n\\n## Biological background, classification, and aims of neuron models\\n\\n**Non-spiking cells, spiking cells, and their measurement**\\n\\nNot all the cells of the nervous system produce the type of spike that defines the scope of the spiking neuron models. For example, [cochlear](/wiki/Cochlea \"Cochlea\") [hair cells](/wiki/Hair_cells \"Hair cells\"), [retinal receptor cells](/wiki/Photoreceptor_cell \"Photoreceptor cell\"), and [retinal bipolar cells](/wiki/Retinal_bipolar_cell \"Retinal bipolar cell\") do not spike. Furthermore, many cells in the nervous system are not classified as neurons but instead are classified as [glia](/wiki/Glial_cell \"Glial cell\").\\n\\nNeuronal activity can be measured with different experimental techniques, such as the \"Whole cell\" measurement technique, which captures the spiking activity of a single neuron and produces full amplitude action potentials.\\n\\nWith extracellular measurement techniques, one or more electrodes are placed in the [extracellular space](/wiki/Extracellular_space \"Extracellular space\"). Spikes, often from several spiking sources, depending on the size of the electrode and its proximity to the sources, can be identified with signal processing techniques. Extracellular measurement has several advantages:\\n\\n**Overview of neuron models**\\n\\nNeuron models can be divided into two categories according to the physical units of the interface of the model. Each category could be further divided according to the abstraction/detail level:\\n\\nAlthough it is not unusual in science and engineering to have several descriptive models for different abstraction/detail levels, the number of different, sometimes contradicting, biological neuron models is exceptionally high. This situation is partly the result of the many different experimental settings, and the difficulty to separate the intrinsic properties of a single neuron from measurement effects and interactions of many cells ([network](/wiki/Biological_neural_network \"Biological neural network\") effects).\\n\\n**Aims of neuron models**\\n\\nUltimately, biological neuron models aim to explain the mechanisms underlying the operation of the nervous system. However, several approaches can be distinguished, from more realistic models (e.g., mechanistic models) to more pragmatic models (e.g., phenomenological models).[[7]](#cite_note-7)[*[better\\xa0source\\xa0needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS \"Wikipedia:NOTRS\")*] Modeling helps to analyze experimental data and address questions. Models are also important in the context of restoring lost brain functionality through [neuroprosthetic](/wiki/Neuroprosthetics \"Neuroprosthetics\") devices.\\n\\n## Electrical input–output membrane voltage models\\n\\nThe models in this category describe the relationship between neuronal membrane currents at the input stage and membrane voltage at the output stage. This category includes (generalized) integrate-and-fire models and biophysical models inspired by the work of Hodgkin–Huxley in the early 1950s using an experimental setup that punctured the cell membrane and allowed to force a specific membrane voltage/current.[[8]](#cite_note-Hod52-8)[[9]](#cite_note-:6-9)[[10]](#cite_note-:7-10)[[11]](#cite_note-:8-11)\\n\\nMost modern [electrical neural interfaces](#ElectricalApplications) apply extra-cellular electrical stimulation to avoid membrane puncturing, which can lead to cell death and tissue damage. Hence, it is not clear to what extent the electrical neuron models hold for extra-cellular stimulation (see e.g.[[12]](#cite_note-:9-12)).\\n\\n### Hodgkin–Huxley\\n\\nExperimental evidence supporting the model\\n\\n| Property of the H&H model | References |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| The shape of an individual spike | [[8]](#cite_note-Hod52-8)[[9]](#cite_note-:6-9)[[10]](#cite_note-:7-10)[[11]](#cite_note-:8-11) |\\n| The identity of the ions involved | [[8]](#cite_note-Hod52-8)[[9]](#cite_note-:6-9)[[10]](#cite_note-:7-10)[[11]](#cite_note-:8-11) |\\n| Spike speed across the axon | [[8]](#cite_note-Hod52-8) |\\n\\nThe Hodgkin–Huxley model (H&H model)[[8]](#cite_note-Hod52-8)[[9]](#cite_note-:6-9)[[10]](#cite_note-:7-10)[[11]](#cite_note-:8-11)\\nis a model of the relationship between the flow of ionic currents across the neuronal cell membrane and the membrane voltage of the cell.[[8]](#cite_note-Hod52-8)[[9]](#cite_note-:6-9)[[10]](#cite_note-:7-10)[[11]](#cite_note-:8-11) It consists of a set of [nonlinear differential equations](/wiki/Nonlinear_system#Nonlinear_differential_equations \"Nonlinear system\") describing the behavior of ion channels that permeate the cell membrane of the [squid giant axon](/wiki/Squid_giant_axon \"Squid giant axon\"). Hodgkin and Huxley were awarded the 1963 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this work.\\n\\nIt is important to note the voltage-current relationship, with multiple voltage-dependent currents charging the cell membrane of capacity *C*m\\n\\n![{\\\\displaystyle C_{\\\\mathrm {m} }{\\\\frac {dV(t)}{dt}}=-\\\\sum _{i}I_{i}(t,V).}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/403ee6f66242e21f5b32b312bf83883a4150af0f)\\n\\nThe above equation is the time [derivative](/wiki/Derivative \"Derivative\") of the law of [capacitance](/wiki/Capacitor#Capacitance_instability \"Capacitor\"), *Q* = *CV* where the change of the total charge must be explained as the sum over the currents.

Typically, these include inward Ca2+ and Na+ input currents, as well as several varieties of K+ outward currents, including a \"leak\" current.\\n\\nThe result can be at the small end of 20 parameters which one must estimate or measure for an accurate model. In a model of a complex system of neurons, [numerical integration](/wiki/Numerical_integration \"Numerical integration\") of the equations are [computationally expensive](/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms \"Analysis of algorithms\"). Careful simplifications of the Hodgkin–Huxley model are therefore needed.\\n\\nThe model can be reduced to two dimensions thanks to the dynamic relations which can be established between the gating variables.[[13]](#cite_note-13) it is also possible to extend it to take into account the evolution of the concentrations (considered fixed in the original model).[[14]](#cite_note-14)[[15]](#cite_note-15)\\n\\n### Perfect Integrate-and-fire\\n\\nOne of the earliest models of a neuron is the perfect integrate-and-fire model (also called non-leaky integrate-and-fire), first investigated in 1907 by [Louis Lapicque](/wiki/Louis_Lapicque \"Louis Lapicque\").[[16]](#cite_note-Abbott_1999-16) A neuron is represented by its membrane voltage *V* which evolves in time during stimulation with an input current *I(t)* according\\n\\n![{\\\\displaystyle I(t)=C{\\\\frac {dV(t)}{dt}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f7c1512d05714b994e2bbac91c28e49d91d01027)\\n\\nwhich is just the time [derivative](/wiki/Derivative \"Derivative\") of the law of [capacitance](/wiki/Capacitor#Capacitance_instability \"Capacitor\"), *Q* = *CV*. When an input current is applied, the membrane voltage increases with time until it reaches a constant threshold *V*th, at which point a [delta function](/wiki/Dirac_delta_function \"Dirac delta function\") spike occurs and the voltage is reset to its resting potential, after which the model continues to run. The *firing frequency* of the model thus increases linearly without bound as input current increases.\\n\\nThe model can be made more accurate by introducing a [refractory period](/wiki/Refractory_period_(physiology) \"Refractory period (physiology)\") *t*ref that limits the firing frequency of a neuron by preventing it from firing during that period. For constant input *I(t)=I* the threshold voltage is reached after an integration time tint=CVthr/I after starting from zero. After a reset, the refractory period introduces a dead time so that the total time until the next firing is *t*ref+*t*int . The firing frequency is the inverse of the total inter-spike interval (including dead time). The firing frequency as a function of a constant input current, is therefore\\n\\n![{\\\\displaystyle \\\\,\\\\!f(I)={\\\\frac {I}{C_{\\\\mathrm {} }V_{\\\\mathrm {th} }+t_{\\\\mathrm {ref} }I}}.}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/706817effaf45cece672817c4b2af0f0737ca204)\\n\\nA shortcoming of this model is that it describes neither adaptation nor leakage. If the model receives a below-threshold short current pulse at some time, it will retain that voltage boost forever - until another input later makes it fire. This characteristic is not in line with observed neuronal behavior. The following extensions make the integrate-and-fire model more plausible from a biological point of view.\\n\\n### Leaky integrate-and-fire\\n\\nThe leaky integrate-and-fire model, which can be traced back to [Louis Lapicque](/wiki/Louis_Lapicque \"Louis Lapicque\"),[[16]](#cite_note-Abbott_1999-16) contains a \"leak\" term in the membrane potential equation that reflects the diffusion of ions through the membrane, unlike the non-leaky integrate-and-fire model. The model equation looks like[[1]](#cite_note-Gerstner_2002-1)\\n\\n![{\\\\displaystyle C_{\\\\mathrm {m} }{\\\\frac {dV_{\\\\mathrm {m} }(t)}{dt}}=I(t)-{\\\\frac {V_{\\\\mathrm {m} }(t)}{R_{\\\\mathrm {m} }}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e92554cf7c0b7e23cc634088c2e5e097765a1371)\\n![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Leaky_Integrate-and-Fire_model_neuron_%28schematic%29.jpg/250px-Leaky_Integrate-and-Fire_model_neuron_%28schematic%29.jpg)\\n\\nwhere *V*m is the voltage across the cell membrane and *R*m is the membrane resistance. (The non-leaky integrate-and-fire model is retrieved in the limit *R*m to infinity, i.e. if the membrane is a perfect insulator). The model equation is valid for arbitrary time-dependent input until a threshold  *V*th is reached; thereafter the membrane potential is reset.\\n\\nFor constant input, the minimum input to reach the threshold is *I*th = *V*th / *R*m. Assuming a reset to zero, the firing frequency thus looks like\\n\\n![{\\\\displaystyle f(I)={\\\\begin{cases}0,&I\\\\leq I_{\\\\mathrm {th} }\\\\\\\\\\\\left[t_{\\\\mathrm {ref} }-R_{\\\\mathrm {m} }C_{\\\\mathrm {m} }\\\\log \\\\left(1-{\\\\tfrac {V_{\\\\mathrm {th} }}{IR_{\\\\mathrm {m} }}}\\\\right)\\\\right]^{-1},&I>I_{\\\\mathrm {th} }\\\\end{cases}}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3d2b9ee97278ff7f139dc76afecd9d3336a35a5b)\\n\\nwhich converges for large input currents to the previous leak-free model with the refractory period.[[17]](#cite_note-Koch98-17) The model can also be used for inhibitory neurons.[[18]](#cite_note-18)[[19]](#cite_note-Cejnar2020-19)\\n\\nThe most significant disadvantage of this model is that it does not contain neuronal adaptation, so that it cannot describe an experimentally measured spike train in response to constant input current.[[20]](#cite_note-20) This disadvantage is removed in generalized integrate-and-fire models that also contain one or several adaptation-variables and are able to predict spike times of cortical neurons under current injection to a high degree of accuracy.[[21]](#cite_note-21)[[22]](#cite_note-Jolivet_2006-22)[[23]](#cite_note-Pozzorini_2013-23)\\n\\n### Adaptive integrate-and-fire\\n\\nExperimental evidence supporting the model\\n\\n| Adaptive integrate-and-fire model model | References |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| Sub-threshold voltage for time-dependent input current | [[22]](#cite_note-Jolivet_2006-22)[[23]](#cite_note-Pozzorini_2013-23) |\\n| Firing times for time-dependent input current | [[22]](#cite_note-Jolivet_2006-22)[[23]](#cite_note-Pozzorini_2013-23) |\\n| Firing Patterns in response to step current input | [[24]](#cite_note-Gerstner_1996-24)[[25]](#cite_note-:17-25)[[26]](#cite_note-:2-26) |\\n\\nNeuronal adaptation refers to the fact that even in the presence of a constant current injection into the soma, the intervals between output spikes increase.

Left: drawing by Ramon y Cajal Right: Image of a real one Overview of Neurons • Neurons are cells, just like in the rest of the body (the fact that neurons are discrete cells rather than a continuous net was first demonstrated by Ramon y Cajal, Nobel Prize 1906) • Unlike other cells, neurons have dendrites, a soma, and an axon. Overview of Neurons • There are many types of neuron with varying morphologies, biophysical properties and computational functions The Cell Membrane • A neuron is like a bag of ions and other molecules. The membrane is made of a lipid bilayer, which itself is impermeable to most of these ions and molecules • Outside the neuron is the extracellular medium, which also contains various ions and molecules • The cell membrane has various ion channels through which ions can sometimes pass in or out. Ion channels can open and close, changing the permeability of the membrane to specific ionic species Some History: “Animal Electricity”/Galvanism • Galvani (1700s) first demonstrated that the nervous system is electrically active • He showed that an applied voltage would cause the legs of a frog to twitch • The action potential was measured much later (Bernstein, 1865) and the first intracellular recording was by Hodgkin and Huxley in 1939.\\nThe Membrane Potential • One can measure a voltage (or “potential”) across the cell membrane of a neuron • This membrane voltage responds to injected current via either graded changes (“subthreshold”) or action potentials/spikes Membrane Potential (Volts) How is the Membrane Potential Generated?\\nThis lecture Next lecture Membrane Potential (Volts) • How do neurons maintain a voltage across their cell membrane? How does the membrane potential respond to injected current? • Subject of this lecture… • How are action potentials generated? Subject of next lecture… Ionic Basis of the Membrane Potential • Neurons maintain a concentration difference of various ionic species across their membrane (mostly Na+, K+, Cl-) • This concentration difference creates a membrane potential (or voltage) due to the net imbalance of charge • The membrane contains various ion channels, some of which are selectively permeable to specific species of ion • Ion channels may open or close depending on membrane voltage or on the binding of neurotransmitter to the membrane Electrical and Chemical Driving Forces • Ions are subject to an electrical driving force when a voltage is applied (force = charge x voltage, F=qV) Electrical and Chemical Driving Forces • Ions are subject to an electrical driving force when a voltage is applied (force = charge x voltage, F=qV) • In the absence of any applied forces (e.g., for uncharged particles), ions flow along their concentration gradient due to random thermal fluctuations (passive diffusion/chemical driving “force”) The Reversal Potential • When both electrostatic force and concentration gradients exist, there is a certain voltage at which the chemical driving force and the electrical driving force exactly cancel • This voltage is called the reversal potential • The reversal potential is the voltage at which no net ionic current will flow across the cell membrane • If the membrane potential is not equal to the reversal potential, ions will flow across the membrane (assuming it is permeable to those ions) The Nernst Equation • The Nernst Equation gives the voltage at which no net current will flow across the cell membrane, for a given concentration of ions inside and outside the cell (called the reversal potential) • The reversal potential E depends on the charge per ion z, the logarithm of the concentration ratio, the temperature T, and two physical constants (the Universal Gas Constant R and Faraday’s Constant F). • This equation can be derived in several ways, see course textbooks if interested The Reversal Potential – Worked Example • Plugging in R=8.31 Joule/mol Kelvin, F=96480 Coulomb/mol, (these are known constants) and setting T=37 Celsius (or 310 Kelvin), gives: The Reversal Potential – Worked Example • Plugging in R=8.31 Joule/mol Kelvin, F=96480 Coulomb/mol, (these are known constants) and setting T=37 Celsius (or 310 Kelvin), gives: Determines the overall scale of reversal potentials The Reversal Potential – Worked Example • Plugging in R=8.31 Joule/mol Kelvin, F=96480 Coulomb/mol, (these are known constants) and setting T=37 Celsius (or 310 Kelvin), gives: • Potassium (K) ions have z=+1, and have a concentration outside and inside of 20 and 400 milli mol respectively, which gives: • Temperature and ionic concentration vary across species and cell types, leading to different reversal potentials Determines the overall scale of reversal potentials The Reversal Potential Reversal Potential - Summary • Neurons have ions inside and outside, but with different concentrations • Two effects cause ions to move across the membrane: diffusion and electric force • The reversal potential is the voltage across the cell membrane at which no net current will flow, for a given species of ion • It depends on the concentration of the ions inside and outside the cell, on the temperature, and the ionic charge • We can calculate the reversal potential using the Nernst equation Typical Ion Concentrations for Mammals Permeable vs Semi-Permeable Membranes Example 1: A box contains sodium and chloride on one side of a permeable membrane. Eventually they diffuse uniformly throughout the box, and no membrane potential is produced.\\nPermeable vs Semi-Permeable Membranes Example 1: A box contains sodium and chloride on one side of a permeable membrane. Eventually they diffuse uniformly throughout the box, and no membrane potential is produced.\\nExample 2: The box contains potassium and another ion A, and the membrane is permeable only to potassium. Potassium flows down the concentration gradient, and creates a charge difference and therefore a membrane potential The Resting Potential • When multiple species of ion are present, the voltage at which no net current flows across the membrane is the cell’s resting potential (Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation) • P = permeability of membrane to ions of each species • The above equation considers three main ionic species (sodium, potassium and chloride), but generalises straightforwardly to any number of ionic species • The relative concentrations of each ionic species, together with their membrane permeabilities, determine the resting potential • The resting potential of neurons in the brain is roughly -70 mV (between the reversal potential of potassium and chloride) The Resting Potential: An Illustration The Resting Potential: A Worked Example • As before, we have RT/F = 27 mV (at T=37 Celsius) • Typical ratios for the ionic permeabilities are PK : PNa : PCl = 1 : 0.05 : 0.45 (so highly permeable to potassium, highly impermeable to sodium) • The concentrations are roughly: Potassium 400:20, Sodium 50:440, 52:560 (inside:outside – measured in squid!) • Plugging this into Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz gives the resting potential: The Resting Potential: A Worked Example The Resting Potential - Summary • The resting potential is the voltage across the cell membrane at which no net current will flow • The resting potential depends on the membrane permeability to each ionic species, and the concentration of each species inside and outside the cell • The resting potential is described by the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation, a generalisation of the Nernst equation • In neurons, the resting potential is mostly determined by potassium (K) and chloride (Cl), to which the membrane is highly permeable Ionic Current Flow • So far we have discussed the reversal and resting potentials, defined as the applied voltage at which no current flows across the cell membrane • However, cells are dynamic – their membrane potential fluctuates in response to external input, and they are rarely at resting/reversal potential • What happens when the membrane potential is not at the reversal/resting potential? How much current will flow across the cell membrane?\\n• We can model this using Ohm’s law! Reversal Potential and Ionic Current Flow • When the membrane potential is not at the resting/reversal potential, ionic currents will flow across the cell membrane • The figure below shows the simple case where only one ionic species is present • Current flows in/out when the electric and chemical driving force do not balance, creating a net electrochemical driving force Ohm’s Law • Ohm’s law relates the current flow I through a material to its resistance R, as a function of the voltage V applied: • The resistance is an intrinsic property of the material (e.g., metal, rubber, cell membranes). It is often more convenient to work with the conductance g: • Ohm’s law assumes a linear relationship between voltage and current, but this isn’t always the case in the real world (non-Ohmic resistors) • Note: in electronics, current is flow of electrons. In neurons, current is flow of both positively and negatively charged ions! Ohm’s Law Model for Ionic Current Flow • We can use Ohm’s law to determine the ionic current flow through the cell membrane: • Where g is the membrane conductance (related to its permeability to ions), E is the reversal potential for the ionic species under consideration. Note the offset by E in this variant of Ohm’s law.\\n• This equation is only an approximation, in reality I-V curves are not linear (non-Ohmic) Example Ionic Current - Potassium Example Ionic Current - Potassium Potassium has a reversal potential around -70 to -90 mV. Reversal potential E Example Ionic Current - Potassium Potassium has a reversal potential around -70 to -90 mV. The linear Ohm’s law approximation is a good model for voltages around the reversal potential, but breaks down for higher voltages (in this particular case…) Reversal potential E Resting Potential and Ionic Current Flow • At the resting potential, each ionic species i typically has a net flow through the membrane - but the total current over all ionic species sums to zero: • Away from the resting potential, applying Ohm’s law gives: • Again, Ohm’s law does not always hold! This is just an approximation… Resting Potential and Ionic Current Flow • At the resting potential, each ionic species i typically has a net flow through the membrane - but the total current over all ionic species sums to zero: • Away from the resting potential, applying Ohm’s law gives: • Again, Ohm’s law does not always hold!

This is just an approximation… Ionic Current Flow - Summary • When the membrane potential is away from the reversal potential of an ionic species, ions will flow across the membrane (if it is permeable to that ion…) • This current flow can be approximated by Ohm’s law • At the resting potential, the total membrane current is zero, but there can still be currents for each species of ion that cancel in sum • Away from the resting potential, the total current can be modelled by a single membrane conductance g_m and resting potential E_m, ignoring individual ionic species Passive Membrane Potential Dynamics • So far we have discussed the reversal and resting potential, and the current that flows across the membrane when the neuron is away from these potentials • How will the membrane potential change when current flows into or out of the neuron? What happens if we inject current through an electrode for example? • Understanding this process is critical to understanding how neurons compute – neurons communicate by injecting current into each other via synapses • This process can be modelled using two simple concepts from physics – capacitance, and current as the rate of change of charge with time Capacitance • A capacitor is two conductors separated by an insulator (e.g., metal plates + air) • When a voltage V is applied across the capacitor, charge Q builds up. We define the capacitance as C = Q/V, i.e. amount of charge per applied voltage Capacitance and Current • When current is applied, it takes time for charge to build up on the capacitor (i.e. for the capacitor to “charge”). How can we model this?\\n• We use two facts: 1) the definition of capacitance: Capacitance and Current • When current is applied, it takes time for charge to build up on the capacitor (i.e. for the capacitor to “charge”).

The relation be-tween neuroscience and dynamical systems provides you with more information about how neurons communicate. In neuronal activity, the major phenomena that occur are resting or quiescent, action potential or spiking, chaotic behaviour and bursting, all of them covered in this project.\\nIn the first chapter, we introduce the more famous and quintessential model that describes neurons dynamics: the Hodgkin-Huxley model. Since it is a four-dimensional model, it is a difficult model to analyze. This caused the emergence of simpler models that displayed some neuron activity that resembles the one exhibited by the Hodgkin-Huxley. In this project, we are going to see FitzHugh-Nagumo, Morris-Lecar and Hindmarsh-Rose model.\\nIn the next chapter, we are going to study the FitzHugh-Nagumo model, which is a simpler model that does not take into account the biological information of neurons focusing exclusively on the mathematical properties. We are going to fo-cus on periodic neurons’ activity, doing simulations of such activity integrating the equations of the model.\\nThe last chapter introduces an important phenomenon in neuronal communi-cation that allows the transmission of more information between neurons: burst-ing excitability. We are going to simulate such phenomena integrating Morris-Lecar and Hindmarsh-Rose model. Those models are fast-slow models with a one-dimensional slow variable. Such underlying structure of the models is essen-tial to create the bifurcation sequences leading to bursting.\\nIn the end, we include a brief summary and conclusions of the work adding some future work we could consider.\\n1 Chapter 1 Hodgkin and Huxley Model 1.1 Previous Content Alan Lloyd Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley [16] are well-known for their studies on bifurcations in neuronal models, being the first ones to relate bifurcations on dynamical systems to neuroscience and creating the most accepted model to de-scribe neurons kinetics. Neuronal models provide information about how neurons interact, how information is transmitted through them. The connection between mathematics and neuroscience leads to a wide range of discoveries, such as the computations of neurons.\\nHodgkin-Huxley model is the most important model computed by Hodgkin and Huxley in 1952 studying the axon of a squid, chosen because of its huge-ness compared to other neurons.\\nThey studied the different changes in mem-brane voltage that the cell undergoes, applying different amplitudes of currents experimentally focusing on the abrupt changes of the membrane voltage, similarly called action potentials or spikes. An action potential is an abrupt and transient change of resting membrane voltage or resting membrane potential, this spike is perceived by other cells and is their communication media. The cell membrane can be depolarized, the membrane voltage can become more positive; it can be hyperpolarized, the membrane potential goes far away from the resting state in a negative way; and repolarized, the membrane voltage lows until the resting state is achieved. The model wanted to study the generation and propagation of an action potential.\\nThe model was issued from studying the neuron as an electric circuit and applying all the properties known there. Firstly, they observed that the membrane had an associated electric capacitance and an electric potential difference between 3 Figure 1.1: Equivalent circuit proposed by Hodgkin and Huxley. Figure taken from [4].\\nthe inside and the outside of the cell, being the inside negative over the exterior.\\nDefinition 1.1. An ion is a charged atom, i.e. an atom that loses or gains one or more electrons. Ion channels are macromolecular pores located in all cells membranes that are constantly opening and closing to signals and responses.\\nIon channels play an important role in the excitability of nerve and muscle, as they have as main function to establish a resting membrane potential. In addition, each channel is like an excitable molecule because it responds to some stimulus such as membrane potential changes, other chemical stimulus, synapses1... Hence, the cell membrane needs to be studied as a circuit containing the conductance of the currents2, i.e. the ability of an ion to fluctuate across the cell membrane, and the membrane capacitance. As not all ions are allowed to flow in and out and the membrane can be permeable or impermeable to some kind of ions, a membrane capacitance is utterly necessary.\\nDefinition 1.2. Gating is the opening or closing of the pore when the channel responds to stimulus. A gate is a channel capable of gating.\\nThere are a lot of ions that take part in biological procedure in human body, some of them are H+, Mg2+, Cl−, Na+, K+, Ca2+, HCO− 3 and HPO2− 4 . When it comes to the nervous system, Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Cl−are the main responsible for the action. The giant axon has three major currents: persistent outward K+ current with four activation gates, transient inward Na+ current with one inacti-vation gate and three activation gates, and a leak current mostly carried by Cl− ions experimentally. Inward Na+ current depolarizes the membrane potential and outward K+ current hyperpolarizes it. The leak current is constant and it does not depend on the conductance, so it does not have activation and inactivation vari-ables as the other ones do. Moreover, on cell membranes, there are places where 1A synapse is a connection between neurons.\\n2A current is any net flow of charges.\\nthe current flows naturally and we cannot control it, which is why we consider the leaky current.\\nExperimentally, Hodgkin and Huxley applied two different techniques: space clamp or voltage-clamp. The space clamp technique consists of preserving a uni-form spatial distribution of the membrane current, removing the spatial depen-dence. Hence, having an ordinary differential equation. The voltage-clamp tech-nique consists of maintaining the voltage of the membrane at a desired value.\\n1.2 Background of the equations The net current of an ion, using Ohm’s law3, is V = IR and the conductance of the membrane is given by g = 1/R, where R is the membrane resistance, V is the potential difference and I is the intensity current, being R, V and, in consequence, I different for each kind of ion. Hence, the size of the current is determined by two factors: the potential difference and the electrical conductance. Joining the prior, we get the expression of the intensity for each ion: Iion = gionVion.\\nDefinition 1.3. [24] The conductance, g, is the ease of flow of current between two points.\\nThe resistance is the reciprocal of the conductance.\\nDefinition 1.4. [24] The potential difference, V, is the work needed to move a unit test charge in a frictionless manner from one point to another.\\nDefinition 1.5. Nernst equilibrium potential value[4] is a potential value for which the current flowing through the membrane stabilizes and equals 0, i.e. net crossing membrane is 0. Due to the depolarizing and hyperpolarizing of the membrane, its goal is to stabilize itself reaching an equilibrium called Nernst equilibrium. The Nernst equilibrium is given by the expression proposed by Walter Nernst: Eion = R∗T zF ln \\x12[Ion]out [Ion]in \\x13 , where T is the temperature in Kelvins, F is the Faraday’s constant, R∗is the universal gas constant, z is the valence4 of the ion, [Ion]in is the concentration of the ion inside the cell and [Ion]out is the concentration of the ion outside the cell.\\n3The Ohm’s law states that the current through an electric circuit between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across such two points. The constant of proportionality is the resistance of the circuit. Hence, we arrive at the mathematical expression: I = V/R.\\n4Valence of an ion is the combining capacity with other atoms when forming molecules or chem-ical elements. For example, if an atom has valence 1 it can be combined with only one atom.\\nIn the model, Vion is called the driving force and is considered V −Eion where Eion is the ion’s Nernst equilibrium potential, which depends on every ion, and V is the global membrane voltage. The driving force is the difference between the global membrane voltage and the Nernst equilibrium. In a current of ions, the voltage needs to be considered V −Eion because the current will be inward or out-ward depending on the Nernst equilibrium. We will have more or less intensity of a current of an ion if the global membrane voltage is further or closer to the Nernst equilibrium of such ion. We will have an inward or outward current if the membrane voltage is bigger or lower than the Nernst equilibrium. For exam-ple, when the sodium concentration is bigger than its equilibrium, the current is inward. In conclusion, the intensity of the current of ions is Iion = gion(V −Eion), (1.1) being the conductance of an ion, gion, not constant on channels because there is a transient inflow or outflow of them and the Nernst equilibrium potential, Eion, constant although it can hold different values in different experiments.\\nFurthermore, the intensity of a current is the instant change of charge: Ic = dq dt , where Ic in the model is the intensity current of the membrane, which has been studied as an electric circuit, and q the charge of the current. The charge is related to the capacitance of the membrane, Cm5, and the global voltage membrane, V, having q = CmV. Deriving with respect to time, we get dq dt = Cm dV dt = Ic. In con-sequence, using First Kirchhoff’s law6 and considering that the total current that travels through the membrane is formed by the intensity current of the membrane, Ic, and the intensity current of the ions, Iions, we have the expression: Ic + Iions = 0, (1.2) and Ic = Cm ∂V ∂t = −Iions.\\nWhen we have an external current, carried out by synapses or applied ex-perimentally, the sum of (1.2) equals the intensity of the applied current, i.e.\\nIext = Ic + Iions, where Iions = ∑ k gk(V −Ek), where k ranges over the finite set of ions we have.\\n5The membrane capacitance, Cm, is considered constant in order to simplify experiments and research.\\n6The first Kirchhoff’s law states that the sum of all intensities inside a circuit equals 0 if no external current is applied, i.e. in a circuit point the sum of all inward currents equals the sum of all outward currents.\\nThe behaviour of an electric current can be described by the equations: Cm dV dt + Iion = Iext. A positive external current, i.e. Iext > 0, will tend to depolarize the cell, whereas a positive ionic current, i.e.\\nIion > 0, will hyperpolarize the cell.\\nTaken into account the different ions on the squid axon, we get the equation that expresses the change in the membrane voltage according to the different channels Cm ˙ V = Iext −IK −INa −IL, (1.3) being ˙ V = dV dt .\\nWhen it comes to the net current of an ion on a channel, we have to take into account that the conductance is a time and voltage-dependent function. Accord-ing to the creation of an action potential, we can see how the flow of each ion changes over time and voltage. Voltage sensors located on the membrane open an activation gate and allow selected ions to flow through the channels or open an inactivation gate that blocks the channel. That is why g for transient ions currents is defined as g = ¯ gmahb, (1.4) where m is the probability of an activation gate being in the open state, h is the probability of an inactivation gate being in the open state, being 0 for closed and 1 for opened, a is the number of activation gates, b is the number of inactivation gates, being a + b the total sum of gates, and ¯ g is the maximum conductance when all the channels are opened. The parameter ¯ g is determined experimentally and it is considered constant for each ion. If an inactivation gate is completely opened, the channel is blocked and ions cannot pass through. Probabilities m and h are also known by gating variables and are not constant due to the procedure of cre-ating an action potential, as we are going to see in section 1.4.\\n1.3 Equations of the Hodgkin-Huxley model Combining equations (1.1), (1.3) and (1.4) and assuming that in the squid giant axon there are three major current: the potassium current, with 4 activation gates with probability n each and 0 inactivation gates, the sodium current, with 3 activa-tion gates with probability m each and 1 inactivation gate with probability h, and the leaky current(carried out mostly by chlorine ions) with no activation gates, i.e.\\nwith a = b = 0 in equation (1.4) and gL = ¯ gL, we can express the Hodgkin-Huxley gate model Cm ˙ V = Iext −¯ gKn4(V −EK) −¯ gNam3h(V −ENa) −gL(V −EL), (1.5) where Iext is the applied current and each activation variable changes with respect to time so we have ˙ n = αn(V)(1 −n) −βn(V)n = \\x12 αn(V) αn(V) + βn(V) −n \\x13 (αn(V) + βn(V)), ˙ m = αm(V)(1 −m) −βm(V)m = \\x12 αm(V) αm(V) + βm(V) −n \\x13 (αm(V) + βm(V)), ˙ h = αh(V)(1 −h) −β(V)h = \\x12 αh(V) αh(V) + βh(V) −n \\x13 (αh(V) + βh(V)), (1.6) where αn(V) = 0.01 10 −V exp \\x00 10−V 10 \\x01 −1, βn(V) = 0.125 exp \\x12−V 80 \\x13 , αm(V) = 0.1 25 −V exp \\x00 25−V 10 \\x01 −1, βm(V) = 4 exp \\x12−V 18 \\x13 , (1.7) αh(V) = 0.07 exp \\x12−V 20 \\x13 , βh(V) = 1 exp \\x00 30−V 10 \\x01 + 1, creating a coupled four-dimensional system.\\nThe Nernst equilibrium potentials and the maximal conductance are predeter-mined at a temperature of 6.3C◦, see [4], as Ek = −12mV, ENa = 120mV, EL = 10.6mV, ¯ gK = 36mS/cm2, ¯ gNa = 120mS/cm2, gL = 0.3mS/cm2.\\n(1.8) The membrane conductance, Cm, is considered 1 in all experimental data Hodgkin-Huxley used. Functions αx(V) and βx(V) for x = n, m, h describe the transition rates between open and closed states of the channels and are voltage-depending functions. These two functions are wisely chosen experimentally to match experi-mental data using the voltage-clamp technique.\\nDefinition 1.6. Steady-state activation or inactivation value(n∞, m∞and h∞) is a value that the gating variables tend to when time tens to infinite and the membrane voltage is clamped. The steady-state value is given by the expression x∞= αx βx + αx , (1.9) for x = n, m, h .\\nCommonly the model is used in a standard form applying the forward change of variables: x∞= αx αx+βx and τx = 1 αx+βx for x = n, m, h, being x∞the steady-state activation or inactivation function and τx the voltage-dependent time constants.\\nHence, we can rewrite (1.6) as ˙ n = n∞(V) −n τn(V) , ˙ m = m∞(V) −m τm(V) , ˙ h = h∞(V) −h τh(V) .\\nThe former equations can be solved as x(t) = x∞+ (xo −x∞) exp \\x10 t τm \\x11 defining the initial value as x(0) = x0 for x = n, m, h.\\nHodgkin-Huxley model is a one-parametric four-dimensional model having only the applied current, Iext, as a parameter.\\nHence, if we want to study its dynamics, we have to study the different kinds of bifurcations being Iext the bi-furcation parameter. Nevertheless, there is a huge limitation when computing the bifurcation diagram of the model because of its dimension. In consequence, there have been studies on simpler planar vector fields and other simpler systems that illustrate some of the solutions of the model, but of course not that exhaustive. For example, we find a twisted homoclinic orbit that for topological reasons cannot be found in a planar system, but there are planar systems that have the same qual-itative properties as the Hodgkin-Huxley without its complexity and having an easier analysis. Some of this simpler models are going to be discussed in sections 1.6 and 2.1.1 and in chapter 2.\\n1.4 Action potential on Hodgkin-Huxley model Figure 1.2 shows how an action potential, an abrupt change in membrane volt-age, works being Vrest = 0 the resting state 7. Due to the higher extracellular concentration of Na+, the current of Na+ flows in, i.e. the probability function m(t) is no longer zero and it starts to increase. This inflow leads to an upstroke on the membrane voltage until the sodium Nernst equilibrium is reached, as we can see on the blue point in figure 1.2. In consequence and in order to stabilize the membrane voltage, the activation of Na+ current leads to a decrease in h(t) and to an increase in n(t) augmenting the K+ outward current. When all activation and inactivation gates are active, the membrane voltage repolarizes again decreas-ing the membrane voltage until reaching the potassium Nernst equilibrium, the 7The resting state is considered Vrest = −70mV in most of the references and experiments, but sometimes is normalized to be at zero, as in [2].\\norange point on figure 1.2, and going through a period where the neuron is not capable of spiking again, called refractory period.\\nDefinition 1.7. A refractory period is a period where there is no possibility of a new action potential and it is located after the upstroke and right before the resting state.\\nFigure 1.2: Action potential in Hodgkin-Huxley model when Iext = 0. Figure obtained using the code A.1 with parameters as (1.8) and equations (1.5) and (1.6).\\nThere is no possibility of a new spike until the neuron is on its recovery phase, close to the resting state and when n(t) and h(t) stabilize. When the membrane voltage is close to Vrest, recovery of n(t) and h(t) is slow, as we can see in figure 1.3, where we displayed the gating variables functions. Hence, the outward K+ current is still activated causing V to go below Vrest causing what is called an after-hyperpolarization, depicted on figure 1.2 between the orange and the green point.\\nWe can see how the resting state is a stable equilibrium, even if we have a strong or a brief depolarization and even if there is inward current enough to generate a spike, the neuron goes back to rest.\\nOn figure 1.3, we can prove that all functions stabilize and tend to a number, which has to be the steady-state value. Using the equation (1.9) and the code in A.1, we can calculate the steady-state value and see if it concurs with figure 1.3. For the potassium activation function, n(t), probability functions stabilize to αn ≈0.05820 and βn ≈0.12499, being n∞≈0.31768, concurring with the red curve in figure 1.3. For the sodium activation function, m(t), probability functions stabi-lize to αm ≈0.22357 and βm ≈3.99994, being m∞≈0.05293, concurring with the red curve on figure 1.3. Finally, for the sodium inactivation function, h(t), proba-bility functions stabilize to αh ≈0.069999 and βh ≈0.04743, being h∞≈0.59811, concurring with the approximate 0.6 value that the black curve tends to in figure 1.3. In addition, we can also see that m(t) initializes and stabilizes fast, faster than the others, and also reaches the maximum value. Activation variable m(t) is incredibly fast, leading to simpler models not taking into account this gating vari-able, such as Morris-Lecar model discussed on section 1.6. Furthermore, we can also see that when m(t) starts to increase, h(t) starts to decrease and n(t) starts to increase, according to the process of creating an action potential explained before.\\nFigure 1.3: Gating variable functions in Hodgkin-Huxley model when Iext = 0, being the sodium activation function, m(t), the blue curve, the potassium activation function, n(t), the red curve and the potassium inactivation function, h(t), the black curve. Figure obtained using the code A.1 with parameters as (1.8) and equations (1.5) and (1.6).\\nIn both figures, we have seen that the fast activation and the slow inactivation of the sodium current is the reason for the creation of an action potential. Hence, the amplitude of the action potential depends on the concentration of sodium on the outside of the cell.\\n1.5 Analysis of the model When the injected current is low, the cell remains quiescent; when the injected current is higher, the cell can fire repetitively or a single spike depending on the intensity of the current injected.\\nIf the current we apply is bigger and longer enough we can have a periodic spiking.\\nDefinition 1.8. A periodic spiking is a set of action potentials that happen repeatedly not necessarily with the same amplitude each. In this case, we have a transition from quiescent to repetitive spikes. From the dynamical systems point of view, we have a transition from a stable equilibrium point to a stable limit cycle considering the injected current, Iext, our bifurcation parameter.\\nI computed a voltage over time graph that exhibits the behaviour of the action potentials for different values of Iext, for different values of applied current. In addition, I graphed how the activation and inactivation gating variables behave for different values of applied current. I computed it using Colab and Python lan-guage and using the experimental data Hodgkin and Huxley used, considering Cm = 1pF/cm2, a temperature of 6.3C◦and all the constant parameters as in (1.8).\\nWhen defining the intracellular potential, one is free to choose a convention that defines the resting intracellular potential or the extracellular potential to be zero. I assumed that my initial potential in this study is V = −70mV, so my extracellular potential is 0 and my intracellular potential would be 70mV at first.\\nWhen I apply a current that is constantly 0, Iext = 0µA, only one spike is gen-erated and then it goes directly to rest, without any kind of oscillation exhibiting the same structure as figure 1.2 and 1.3. In consequence, the Vrest is a stable equi-librium point.\\nIf we apply a constant intensity of 20µA, Iext = 20µA, a periodic spiking activ-ity is observed in figure 1.4. A stable limit cycle was born and the amplitude of it is constant except from the first spike. If we do not apply any change, the neuron would spike forever via a periodic spiking behaviour.\\nFigure 1.4: Action potential(left) and activation and inactivation of sodium and potassium chan-nels(right) on Hodgkin-Huxley model when Iext = 20µA. Figure obtained using the code A.1 with Cm = 1, T = 6.3C◦, parameters as in (1.8) and equations (1.5) and (1.6).\\nWhen we keep augmenting the intensity, the periodicity of the spikes is being maintained but its amplitude is lower every time until a certain value is reached and the neuron does not spike and goes back to rest. In figure 1.5, where we applied an intensity current of 75µA, the amplitude of the action potential is lower and it would be even lower if we keep on increasing the applied current.\\nFigure 1.5: Action potential(left) and activation and inactivation of sodium and potassium chan-nels(right) on Hodgkin-Huxley model when Iext = 75µA. Figure obtained using the code in A.1 with Cm = 1, T = 6.3◦, parameters as in (1.8) and equations (1.5) and (1.6).\\nProvided that a certain value of Iext is reached, approximately around Iext = 125µA, the neuron is not able to spike periodically and it goes back to rest oscil-lating, as we can see in figure 1.6. In this case, Vrest is a stable equilibrium point and the stable limit cycle has vanished. We can see that our equilibrium point is approximately V = 25mV. In fact, if we solve the equation (1.5) for V, being Iext = 200, Cm = 1, gx and Ex for x = Na, K, L as (1.8) and the activation and inac-tivation function being equal to their steady-state value for this applied intensity, i.e. n(t) = n∞= 0.669956, m(t) = m∞= 0.479992 and h(t) = h∞= 0.054814, we get the solution V ≈24.5702, concurring with figure 1.6(left).\\nFigure 1.6: Action potential(left) and activation and inactivation of sodium and potassium chan-nels(right) on Hodgkin-Huxley model when Iext = 200µA. Figure obtained using the code in A.1 with Cm = 1, T = 6.3C◦, parameters as in (1.8) and equations (1.5) and (1.6).\\nIf we keep on augmenting the applied current over Iext = 200µA, the oscilla-tions before going back to rest are shorter every time. If we keep on augmenting the intensity, the action potential resembles the one in figure 1.2.\\nWe can also study the phase plain of the activation and inactivation variables over other activation and inactivation variables and over voltage. For example, we can plot the (n, h), (m, n) and (V, n) graph when Iext = 15µA, following [10].\\nFigure 1.7: Phase plane projections for equations (1.5) and (1.7). The left one is n versus h, the center one is m versus n and the left one is V versus n. Figures obtained from A.1 with Iext = 15µA, Cm = 1, the values of the parameters as in (1.8) and the equations (1.5) and (1.6).\\nIn figure 1.7(left), we can see that there exists a correlation between the activa-tion variable of the potassium, n, and the inactivation of the sodium, h, concretely h ≈0.8 −n, see [4]. In addition, in figure 1.7(center), we can see how the activation variable of the sodium, m, is faster than the activation variable of the potassium, n, concurring with the procedure of creating an action potential explained in section 1.4 and with figure 1.3. Lastly, in figure 1.7(right) we can see how the value of n oscillates creating a limit cycle over the membrane voltage, V.\\nTo sum up, the (t, V)-graph passes through three stages: an equilibrium stage, a single-spike stage and a limit cycle stage, i.e. periodic spiking stage. When no external current is applied, we have a stable equilibrium point. If the external input increases enough, a stable limit cycle is created undergoing a supercritical Andronov Hopf bifurcation, the bifurcation associated with the birth of a limit cycle from a stable equilibrium point. Moreover, if we increase the external applied current the system has a stable equilibrium point again undergoing an Andronov Hopf bifurcation, explained in section 2.3.1.\\n1.6 Morris-Lecar model Hodgkin-Huxley model is capable of exhibiting a single spike, a train of spikes, periodic spikes, bursting and chaotic behaviour.\\nDefinition 1.9.

At large values of v 2+w 2{\\\\displaystyle v^{2}+w^{2}}![Image 18: {\\\\displaystyle v^{2}+w^{2}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3f95904ed19d9944b2f11c7ceea77087eb347868), far from origin, the flow is a clockwise circular flow, consequently the [sum of the index for the entire vector field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9%E2%80%93Hopf_theorem \"Poincaré–Hopf theorem\") is +1.

The three models were: Hodgkin-Huxley, FitzHugh-Nagumo, and Morris-Lecar. Using diﬀerential equations, linear algebra, and computer assisted simulations in the computer program MatLab, we were able to approximate numerical solutions and do phase portrait analysis and bifurcation analysis for each of the three models. We also came up with a modiﬁed form of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model using a Sine Function.\\n1 1 Introduction A considerable question to answer is how does the body process information. For example, if a person touches a hot stove with his or her hand, the hand must send information to brain, which registers the data and sends a message back to the hand to pull away. In order to understand the dynamics of the process, it is important to understand the composition of neuron cells and nerve impulse transmission. In this paper, we will analyze a few proposed models that describe how information is transmitted through a neuron.\\nTo begin with, it is important to note the physical make up of a cell.\\nThe cell membrane is a bi-layer that is per-meable to certain materials. In other words, it allows some materials to pass through it while blocking the passage of others. During naturally occurring processes, some ionic compounds such as potassium chloride (KCl) will disassociate and try to diﬀuse through the cell membrane. Since the cell membrane is selectively permeable to K+, the K+ will diﬀuse through the cell membrane leaving the Cl−behind. The process will create a positive net ﬂow of charge into or out of the cell depending on the concentration diﬀerence. Consequently, there will be a electrical potential diﬀerence with one side of the cell membrane more positive than the other. Hence, the cell membrane can be viewed as a capacitor with the bi-layer being two charged plates. Thus, the cell membrane has a capacitance, an assumption needed to derive the subsequent nerve impulse transmission models.\\nAccordingly, let there be a stimulus, such as the heat from the stove, the brain must send a signal to the hand to pull away. The brain sends messages through the body via electrical currents, also known as action potentials. When a stimulus is applied, a sodium ion channel opens up and allows an inﬂux of sodium ions to come into the cell. The cell is generally polarized, however when the sodium rushes into the cell, the cell becomes depolarized at that point. Once the cell reaches a threshold potential more sodium ion channels open up and the depolarization moves down the cell.\\nThis process is called the action potential. Once the action potential has passed, the sodium ion channels close, and the sodium-potassium pump works to get the cell back to its normal resting potential, which is around −70 mV .\\nThe modeling of the forementioned process through mathematics is diﬃcult, but there are several approaches. A well accepted approach is the Hodgkin-Huxley model proposed in 1952 by Alan Lloyd Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley. The Hodgkin-Huxley model consists of four diﬀerential equations, which is hard to analyze.\\nTherefore, there are simpler models that exhibit the behavior of the Hodgkin-Huxley model qualitatively. Two such models we will examine are the FitzHugh-Nagumo model and Morris-Lecar, both of which are only a set of two diﬀerential equations; thus, they will be simpler to analyze and solve.\\n2 Hodgkin-Huxley Model 2.1 Derivation of Hodgkin-Huxley Model The Hodgkin-Huxley model is based on the idea that the electrical properties of a segment of a cell membrane can be modeled by an equivalent circuit. In the picture below, one can see the ﬂow of current (denoted by I) through the circuit.\\n2 Above: The equivalent circuit to a segment of the cell membrane.\\nPicture from http://thephysicsdomain.com/2013/03/28/047-hodgkin-huxley-hysteria/ Because a cell membrane behaves very much like a capacitor, the derivation of the Hodgkin-Huxley model for ion transport across a cell membrane begins with the general physical deﬁnition of capacitance: C = Q(r, t) V (r, t) (1) with r = r(x, y, z), (2) where C is capacitance, r is the spatial coordinates vector, Q(r, t) is electrical charge as a function of space and time and V (r, t) is electric potential (or voltage) as a function of space and time. For a cell membrane, provided that the membrane capacitance (now denoted by Cm) remains constant and electric current is the rate of change of electric charge with respect to time ( ∂Q ∂t ), conservation laws dictate that the capacitive current, denoted by I(V, r, t), would be ∂Q ∂t = Cm ∂V ∂t = I(V, r, t) = −∇· J(r) + Iion(V, t) (3) where, Iion(V, t) is the cell membrane current and J(r) is the space dependent current vector.\\nSo, more speciﬁcally, Equation (3) becomes Cm ∂V ∂t = −∇· J(r) + Iion(V, t), (4) However, using space clamps positioned at speciﬁc points along the membrane will make the voltage uniform across the system, meaning that the space dependence can be ignored, i.e.\\n∇· J(r) = 0 (5) reducing Equation (3) further down to Cm dV (t) dt = Iion(V, t).\\n(6) 3 Now consider the movement of an ion A across the membrane, moving transverse to Iion.\\nThe transverse potential drop across the membrane due to the concentration diﬀerences caused by this movement is given by the Nernst Potential: VA = RT zF ln [A]e [A]i , (7) where [A]i and [A]e denote respective internal and external concentrations of the ion A, R is the universal gas constant, T is absolute temperature, F is Faraday’s constant, and z is the charge of ion A. The potential drop across the membrane due to a transverse electrical current is denoted by 1 g(Iτ), where g is the membrane conductance. Summing these two potential drops (yielding the total potential V ) and than solving for the transverse current yields Iτ = g(V −VA).\\n(8) For multiple types of ions moving across the membrane the transverse current becomes Iτ = X j gj(V −Vj).\\n(9) where j is the number of ion types (including leakage).\\nUsing the principle in Kirchoﬀ’s current law that the sum of all currents in a closed system equals zero, or X k Ik = 0, (10) we can deduce that Iion + Iτ = 0 ⇒Iion = −Iτ.\\n(11) When a disturbance occurs (such as external stimuli acting on the cell), then the sum of the two former currents will equal the external or applied current (denoted by Iapp), giving us Iion = −Iτ + Iapp, (12) which yields our ﬁrst diﬀerential equation: Cm dV (t) dt = − X j gj(V −Vj) + Iapp.\\n(13) Note: Iapp here is in units of µA/cm2 and could either be constant or a function of time (e.g. sinusiodal current).\\nWhen a stimulus occurs, the sodium ion channels open and there is an inﬂux of sodium ions rushing into the cell. Once the action potential has moved further along the cell axon the sodium ion channels close and the potassium ion channels open. For this system with sodium (Na) and potassium (K) ions passing across the cell membrane (with some ion leakage L), Equation (13) becomes Cm dV (t) dt = −¯ gNa(V −VNa) −¯ gK(V −VK) −gL(V −VL) + Iapp, (14) with gL being an experimentally determined constant. If the values of ¯ gK and ¯ gNa are also held constant, the model breaks down. Therefore, the membrane conductances of Sodium and Potassium must be treated as functions of voltage as well as time, i.e ¯ gNa(V, t) = FNa(V, t) (15) ¯ gK(V, t) = FK(V, t) (16) making the Sodium conductance ∂¯ gNa ∂t = fNa(V, t) = gNam3h, (17) 4 now with gNa being an experimentally determined constant, m being the sodium ion activation gates (there are three between the space clamps, hence m3 which is consistent with experimental data), and h being the sodium ion deactivation gate. Both m and h are functions of time and satisfy the following two diﬀerential equations: dm(t) dt = αm(V )(1 −m) −βm(V )m (18) dh(t) dt = αh(V )(1 −h) −βh(V )h, (19) where the coeﬃcients αm(V ), βm(V ), αh(V ), and βh(V ) are all experimentally determined functions of voltage. Similarly for Potassium, the conductance is ∂¯ gK ∂t = fK(V, t) = gKn4, (20) with gK now also being an experimentally determined constant and n being the potassium ion inﬂux gates (there are four between the space clamps, hence the n4 which also is consistent with experimental data), which is a function of time and satisﬁes the last of four diﬀerential equations: dn(t) dt = αn(V )(1 −n) −βn(V )n, (21) where the coeﬃcients αn(V ) and βn(V ) are also functions of voltage determined by experimental results.\\nUsing experimental data, Hodgkin and Huxley chose the following values for these six coeﬃcient functions of voltage: αm(V ) = (0.1)(25 −V ) e( 25−V 10 ) −1 (22) βm(V ) = 4e −V 18 (23) αh(V ) = (0.07)e −V 20 (24) βh(V ) = 1 e( 30−V 10 ) + 1 (25) αn(V ) = (0.01)(10 −V ) e( 10−V 10 ) −1 (26) βn(V ) = (0.125)e −V 80 .\\n(27) Thus, our system of four diﬀerential equations modeling the behavior of a stimulated cell membrane is: Cm dV (t) dt = −gKn4(V −VK) −gNam3h(V −VNa) −gL(V −VL) + Iapp (28) dm(t) dt = αm(V )(1 −m) −βm(V )m (29) dh(t) dt = αh(V )(1 −h) −βh(V )h (30) dn(t) dt = αn(V )(1 −n) −βn(V )n (31) with conductance constants: gK = 36µS/cm2 gNa = 120µS/cm2 gL = 0.3µS/cm2 (32) 5 ion voltage constants: VNa = 115mV VK = −12mV VL = 10.6mV (33) membrance capacitance constant: Cm = 1.0µF/cm2 (34) and initial conditions for membrane potential and the dimensionless gating variables: V (0) = −70mV m(0) = 0 h(0) = 0 n(0) = 0 (35) 2.2 Analysis of the Hodgkin-Huxley Model Because it is impossible to ﬁnd an explicit solution for the Hodgkin-Huxley model, computer simulations are required to approximate the graphs of the system of equations. To analyze what the model means, we ﬁrst simulate the membrane potential as a function of time with no applied current (Iapp = 0µA/cm2) and the dimensionless gating variables, each as a function of time, with a time period of 150 milliseconds.\\n0 50 100 150 0 50 100 150 200 Hodkin−Huxley: Time vs. Voltage with Iapp=0 t (milliseconds) V (mV) V(t), Voltage 0 50 100 150 0 0.5 1 Hodkin−Huxley: Solution of Gating Variables t m,n,h m(t), Potassium Activation n(t), Sodium Activation h(t), Sodium Deactivation From these graphs, we can see that without an external stimulus, there will be one oscillation and then the membrane returns to equilibrium. Because of the complexity of this system, there will always be at least one spike no matter what the initial conditions are.\\nHodgkin-Huxley: Constant Current When a constant external current is applied (e.g. Iapp = 20µA/cm2), there will be continuous oscillations, as shown in the following graphs: 6 0 50 100 150 0 50 100 150 200 Hodkin−Huxley: Time vs. Voltage with Iapp=20 t (milliseconds) V (mV) 0 50 100 150 0 0.5 1 Hodkin−Huxley: Solution of Gating Variables t m,n,h V(t), Voltage m(t), Potassium Activation n(t), Sodium Activation h(t), Sodium Deactivation Because the applied current is constant, the oscillations are smooth and steady. If the applied current is below 6.26 µA/cm2 (say Iapp = 6.25µA/cm2) the oscillations will fall oﬀwithin the 150 millisecond time period.\\n0 50 100 150 0 50 100 150 200 Hodkin−Huxley: Time vs. Voltage with Iapp=6.25 t (milliseconds) V (mV) 0 50 100 150 0 0.5 1 Hodkin−Huxley: Solution of Gating Variables t m,n,h V(t), Voltage m(t), Potassium Activation n(t), Sodium Activation h(t), Sodium Deactivation At 100 µA/cm2, the oscillations are a lot smaller after the initial spike but don’t die oﬀyet within the 150 millisecond time period.\\n0 50 100 150 0 50 100 150 200 Hodkin−Huxley: Time vs. Voltage with Iapp=100 t (milliseconds) V (mV) V(t), Voltage 0 50 100 150 0 0.5 1 Hodkin−Huxley: Solution of Gating Variables t m,n,h m(t), Potassium Activation n(t), Sodium Activation h(t), Sodium Deactivation 7 By 175 µA/cm2, the oscillations are dying oﬀquickly and returning to equilibrium within the 150 millisecond time period once again.\\n0 50 100 150 0 50 100 150 200 Hodkin−Huxley: Time vs. Voltage with Iapp=175 t (milliseconds) V (mV) 0 50 100 150 0 0.5 1 Hodkin−Huxley: Solution of Gating Variables t m,n,h V(t), Voltage m(t), Potassium Activation n(t), Sodium Activation h(t), Sodium Deactivation Hodgkin-Huxley: Sinusiodal Current If instead of a constant external current, we apply an in-phase sinusiodal current with an angular frequency of 1 rad/s and an amplitude of 20 µA/cm2 (e.g. Iapp = 20 sin t) our graphs are: 0 50 100 150 0 50 100 150 200 Hodkin−Huxley: Time vs. Voltage with Sinusoidal Applied Current t (seconds) V (mV) V(t), Voltage 0 50 100 150 0 0.5 1 Hodkin−Huxley: Solution of Gating Variables t m,n,h m(t), Potassium Activation n(t), Sodium Activation h(t), Sodium Deactivation giving us bumpier yet continuous oscillations.\\n8 Phase Portrait Analysis In order to get a nullcline plot, we must ﬁx two of the three gating variables. We will also ﬁx Iapp back to 20 µA/cm2.\\nIf we ﬁx n and h, that leaves us with m as a function of V in the following graph: 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 Hodking−Huxley: Phase Portrait with n and h fixed V m Voltage vs. Sodium Activation Gate Likewise, if we ﬁx m and n, we get a graph with h as a function of V: 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 Hodking−Huxley: Phase Portrait with m and n fixed V h Voltage vs. Sodium Deactivation Gate And n as a function of V with m and h ﬁxed yields: 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 Hodking−Huxley: Phase Portrait with m and h fixed V n Voltage vs. Potassium Activation Gate From these graphs, it’s clear that as the sodium channels close, the potassium channels open. Hence the phase portraits for h and n being mirror images of each other.\\n2.3 Solving Hodgkin-Huxley Numerically Due to the diﬃculty in explicitly solving this four dimensional system (as noted above), another method must be used to approximate the solutions of the system. One of various numerical methods to solve such a system is the Runge-Kutta method of order. Using this method yields the following graphs: 9 The top graph here shows the duration of an applied stimulus. The middle graph shows oscillations, which is the depiction for the action potential moving along the cell membrane for the duration of the applied stimulus. The bottom graph shows the activation and deactivation of the gating variables.\\n10 3 FitzHugh-Nagumo Model 3.1 From Hodgkin-Huxley to FitzHugh-Nagumo From the Hodgkin-Huxley model, we know that the cell-membrane carries potential across the inner and outer surface of the cell. However, with the use of the voltage ion channels and currents that ﬂow through it, shows the electrical behavior of the cell by using a system of four diﬀerential equations. The Hodgkin-Huxley is considered to be diﬃcult to non- dimensionalize because of the diﬃculty to do the partial derivative for four equations. So, its very simple to half the Hodgkin- Huxley into two equations. Overtime, the system of equations being use in the Hodgkin-Huxley model can be modiﬁed into a simpliﬁed form of two diﬀerential equations. This type of system, that involve a linear nullcline for the slow variable and an N shaped Nullcline for the fast variable that forms oscillation. This became the motivation of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model. The FitzHugh-Nagumo consist of variable, one fast(v) and one slow(w).The fast variable has a cubic nullcline and its called the dependent variable, and the slow variable is the recovery variable that is consistently increasing. A parameter that plays a major role in the FitzHugh-Nagumo model is Epsilon .This parameter has been added to more easily control the speed of one variable that is connected to the other. The FitzHugh-Nagumo doesnt need to be biologically based to solve the model like the Hodgkin-Huxley, but simply mathematically based. Since the FitzHugh-Nagumo model is simpliﬁed version of the Hodgkin-Huxley which models the activation and deactivation dynamics of the cell membrane, gave way of the idea that the cell-membrane relates more to a non-linear current-voltage device or electrical circuit with three components; a resistor, inductor, and a battery. This system was suggested by Fitzhugh and the equivalent circuit by Nagumo himself. By using the Kirchhoﬀs Law, Nagumo gave us diﬀerential equations for the behavior of the cell-membrane circuit which will be mention in this report.\\n3.2 Fitz-Hugh Nagumo The Hodgkin-Huxley model can be represented in terms of two variables, one fast and one slow. The FitzHugh-Nagumo model presents this as a simpliﬁed form with (v) being the fast variable and (w) being the slow one. The general set of equations for the FitzHugh-Nagumo model are: ϵdv dt = f(v, w) + I (36) and dw dt = g(v, w) (37) The nullcline f(v, w) = 0 of the fast variable (v) is has a cubic shape, while the nullcline g(v, w) = 0 of the slow variable (w) is monotonically increasing. The nullclines of both the fast and slow variables have a single intersection point denoting the critical point. Thus, the graph of the phase plane of these nullclines is Figure 1: This image was taken from Sneyd and Keener’s ”Mathematical Physiology” We start by understanding cell membrane capacitance. It is a nonlinear current-voltage device. A Japanese electrical engineer, Nagumo, built this nonlinear circuit in the 1960s using a tunnel diode.\\n11 Figure 2: This image was taken from Sneyd and Keener’s ”Mathematical Physiology Using the Kirchoﬀ’s laws, the equations for the circuit diagram are: Cm dV dτ + F(V ) + i = −I0.\\n(38) and L di dτ + Ri = V −V0 (39) where I0 is the applied external current, i is the current that is traveling through the resistor-inductor into battery V0 that give us the potential gain across the battery. The membrane potential is diﬀerentiated to the dimensional time (τ). The reason is that time (t) is introduced as a dimensionless time variable. The function F(V) is assumed to be the ”cubic” shape, but that is more into the electrical physics side of the model. After Electrical physicist introduce the dimensionless variables, V V1 , w = R1i V1 , f(v) = −R1F (V1v) V1 , and t = Lτ R1 , the diﬀerential equation becomes the function of both state variables (v, w) ϵd(v) d(t) = f(v) −w −w0 (40) d(w) d(t) = v −γw −v0 (41) where, ϵ = R2 1Cm L , w0 = R1I0 V1 , v0 = V0 V1 , and γ = R R1 . Epsilon (ϵ) controls the speed of the parameter of the equation and Gamma (γ) is the slope of the equation.\\nThe two sets of equations that we used to give the Fitzhugh-Naguno models are A = \\uf8f1 \\uf8f4 \\uf8f2 \\uf8f4 \\uf8f3 0.01dv dt = v(v −0.1)(1 −v) −w + I dw dt = v −0.5w (42) B = \\uf8f1 \\uf8f4 \\uf8f2 \\uf8f4 \\uf8f3 0.01dv dt = v(v + 0.1)(1 −v) −w + I dw dt = v −0.5w (43) 12 Solving these sets of equations will yield the following graphs: Figure 3: Graph of A Figure 4: Graph of B The fast variable, v, is shown in blue and the slow variable, w, is shown in green. Notice that the graph of A only has one spike while the graph of B spontaneous oscillates. The only diﬀerence between the sets of equations (7) and (8) is the sign on (v ± 0.1). There was no external current applied to either equation (I = 0). In order for A to oscillate like B, a contant external current needs to be applied. This will be shown later. This is very important. With no external current applied, the graph should spike and then die out. This tells us that the (+) instead of the (−) sign is critical. The set of equations in B would not be ideal to use because it does not model natural behavior. With no applied stimulus, there should not be spontaneous oscillations.\\nBelow are the phase planes for each of the two graphs: Figure 5: Phase portrait of A Figure 6: Phase portrait of B For A, the nullcline for v is w = −v3 + 1 + 1.1V 2 −0.1v which is shown in blue and the nullcline for w is g(v) = 2v and is shown in green. For |boldcymbolB, the nullcline for v is w = −v3 + 1 + 0.9V 2 −0.1v which is shown in blue and the nullcline for w is g(v) = 2v and is shown in green.Notice that each of the graphs are identical with Sneyd and Keener’s illustration of the phase plane (Figure 1). Just as the graph of A only had one peak before it died out, the phase plane of A starts at the initial condition and only does one orbit. The graph of B oscillates and likewise, the phase plane has continuous orbit.\\n13 The nullclines intersect at (0,0), which is the only critical point. In order to see the stability of the critical point, we computed the Jacobian at (0,0).\\nJ(0, 0) = \\uf8eb \\uf8ec \\uf8ec \\uf8ec \\uf8ec \\uf8ed ∂(f) ∂(v) (0, 0) ∂(f) ∂(w)(0, 0) ∂(g) ∂(v)(0, 0) ∂(g) ∂(w)(0, 0) \\uf8f6 \\uf8f7 \\uf8f7 \\uf8f7 \\uf8f7 \\uf8f8 = \\uf8eb \\uf8ed −3(0)2 + 2.2(0) −0.1 −1 1 −0.5 \\uf8f6 \\uf8f8= \\uf8eb \\uf8ed −0.1 −1 1 −0.5 \\uf8f6 \\uf8f8 The eigenvalues for this matrix are λ = 0.3+0.9798i and λ = 0.3−0.9798i. This means that the critical point is stable and spiral.\\nNext we want to see the changes of behavior in our functions when one parameter changes. Thus, we do a bifurcation analysis testing diﬀerent values of I, γ, and ϵ. The general form of the studied FHN model is A = \\uf8f1 \\uf8f2 \\uf8f3 f(v, w) = 1 ϵv(v −α)(1 −v) −w + I g(v, w) = v −γw (44) The original values of I, γ, and ϵ were I = 0, γ = 0.5, and ϵ = 0.01. The following graphs show the variations in the oscillations for diﬀerent parameter values.\\n14 Adding constant current gives the following changes to the graph of A: Figure 7: I = 0 − →One spike, no oscillations Figure 8: I = 0.1 − →Oscillations die out, not enough stimuli Figure 9: I = 1 − →Constant oscillations Figure 10: I = 10, − →Too much applied current Studying these parameter values tells us that the constant applied current, I, is 0.11 < I < 1.2.\\n15 With a constant applied current of I = 1, changing values of γ gives the following changes to the graph of A: Figure 11: γ = 0.05 − →Oscillations die out Figure 12: γ = 0.5 − →Constant oscillations Figure 13: γ = 0.7 − →Model does not work Studying these parameter values tells us that the values of γ need to be 0.05 < γ < 0.6.\\n16 With a constant applied current of I = 1 and γ = 0.5, changing values of ϵ gives the following changes to the graph of A: Figure 14: ϵ = 0.01 − →Continuous oscillations Figure 15: ϵ = 0.1 − →Oscillations die out Figure 16: ϵ = 0.0001 − →Continuous oscillations Studying these parameter values tells us that the values of ϵ need to be ϵ < 0.1.\\n17 3.3 Modiﬁed FitzHugh-Nagumo Model The FitzHugh-Nagumo general model has two equations whose nullclines display a cubic shape function and a mono-tonically increasing function. The new cubic shape function, f(v, w), that we derived with the previous increasing function, g(v, w), is: A = \\uf8f1 \\uf8f2 \\uf8f3 f(v, w) = 1 ϵsin(v) −w + I g(v, w) = v −γw (45) The model behaves the same way as the original FHN model and exhibits the same phase plane.\\nFigure 17: Original FHN Phase Plane Figure 18: Modiﬁed FHN Model Graph Figure 19: Modiﬁed FHN Model Phase Plane The function, f(v, w), has parameter values of ϵ = 0.01, an applied stimulus of I = 1, and γ = 0.5. Though the function does not ﬁt a biological model because it oscillates even without applied stimulus, it still has the same behavior as the original FHN model.\\nThe nullclines intersect at (0,0), which is the only critical point. In order to see the stability of the critical point, we computed the Jacobian at (0,0).\\n18 J(0, 0) = \\uf8eb \\uf8ec \\uf8ec \\uf8ec \\uf8ec \\uf8ed ∂(f) ∂(v) (0, 0) ∂(f) ∂(w)(0, 0) ∂(g) ∂(v)(0, 0) ∂(g) ∂(w)(0, 0) \\uf8f6 \\uf8f7 \\uf8f7 \\uf8f7 \\uf8f7 \\uf8f8 = \\uf8eb \\uf8ed 0.8cos(0) −1 1 −0.5 \\uf8f6 \\uf8f8= \\uf8eb \\uf8ed 0.8 −1 1 −0.5 \\uf8f6 \\uf8f8 The eigenvalues for this matrix are λ = 0.15 + 0.759934i and λ = 0.15 −0.759934i. This means that the critical point is stable and spiral. The behavior of the critical point is identical with the behavior of the critical point in the original FHN model.\\n19 4 Morris-Lecar Model 4.1 History of the Morris-Lecar Model In 1981, Charles Morris and Harold Lecar proposed their eponymous equation as an reduced excitation model in the vein of the Hogdkin-Huxley equations, which constitutes an exact description of the conductance-based model for the giant squid neuron. In particular, they begin with an ”already reduced” system of equations taken from the voltage clamp studies of Keynes, which proposes that the relevant state variables for the barnacle muscle are, along with the membrane potential, the proportion of voltage dependent Ca+ and K+ ion channels open at a given time(in which, the Na+ conduction plays no signiﬁcant role in dynamics). The Morris-Lecar Model is a two-dimensional ”reduced” excitation model applicable to systems having two non-inactivating voltage-sensitive conductance. The original form of the model employed an instantaneously responding voltage-sensitive Ca+ conductance for excitation and a delay voltage-dependent K+ conductance for recovery. The biological system studied was the Purkinje ﬁbers through its membrane potential and the concentrations which had an eﬀect on it. This model used a simpliﬁed version of the Hodgkin-Huxley model. A reduced system of equations was created that produce the same results for most cases. In order to approximate the muscle reactions appropriately, the models are based oﬀof one you would use to follow an equivalent circuit design.\\n4.2 Morris-Lecar Using the Morris-Lecar Model, techniques employed are known as current and space clamping, which essentially eliminated spatial variations the traveling action potential and ﬁxed the current across the membrane to set parameter which the experimenter could control.\\nThen in order to reduce the model, they submerged the barnacle muscle in various solutions in order to eliminate either Ca+ and Na+ conductance, or in the case of the Morris-Lecar equation, simultaneously optimize them. By doing this, they reduced the dynamics of the system to two state variables (depending on which solution the barnacle is submersed in), which considerably simpliﬁes possible behavior the system can exhibit due to special topological properties of the phase plane that is not enjoy by higher dimensional Euclidean space (namely that a simple closed curve divides the plane into two distinct connected components.\\n4.2.1 Principle Assumptions Generally, excitable systems have more than two relevant excitation variables, because there are often more than two species of gated channels and also because some channels have autonomous inactivation processes. Thus the pri-mary assumption in using a two-dimensional model is that the true higher-order system can in fact be projected onto a two-dimensional phase space without altering the topological properties of the phase proﬁle. This is true for the four-dimensional Hodgkin-Huxley system, which has a single singular point and exhibits excitation phenomena that can all be duplicated in two dimensions. There are other neural excitation phenomena such as bursting oscillations or chaotic ﬁring which are intrinsically higher-dimensional, and cannot be duplicated in the phase plane. The principal assumptions underlying the Morris-Lecar model include: • Equations apply to a spatially iso-potential patch of membrane.\\n• There are two persistent (non-inactivating) voltage-gated currents with oppositively biased reversal potentials. The depolarizing current is carried by Na+ or Ca2+ ions (or both), depending on the system to be modeled, and the hyperpolarizing current is carried by K+.\\n• Activation gates follow changes in membrane potential suﬃciently rapidly that the activating conductance can instantaneously relax to its steady-state value at any voltage.\\n20 • The dynamics of the recovery variable can be approximated by a ﬁrst-order linear diﬀerential equation for the probability of channel opening.\\nThis assumption is never exactly true, since channel proteins are composed of subunits, which must act in concert, to reach the open state. Despite missing delays in the onset of recovery, the model appears to be adequate for phase-plane considerations for many excitable systems.\\n4.2.2 Variables and Parameter of Morris-Lecar Model Listed below are the dimensional parameters and variables for the Morris-Lecar Model: • V - Membrane Potential (mV ) • W - Recovery Variable (mV ) • Iapp - Applied Current Stimulus( µA cm2 ) • T - Time (ms) • Cm - Membrane Capacitance( µF cm2 ) • g - Instantaneous(or maximum) Membrane Conductance( mmho cm2 ) • VCa, VK, VL - equilibrium potential corresponding to leak, Ca++, and K+ conductances, respectively (mV ) • v1 - potential (mV ) • v2 - reciprocal of slope of voltage dependence (mV ) • v3 - potential (mV ) • v4 - reciprocal of slope of voltage dependence (mV ) • K - Potassium • Ca - Calcium • L - Leakage 4.2.3 Morris-Lecar Model Using the variables from the previous section, Morris and Lecar was able to derive the equations of the model: Cm dV dt = −gCaM∞(V )(V −VCa) −gKW(V −Vk) −gL(V −VL) + Iapp (46) dW dt = W∞(V ) −W TW (V ) (47) 4.3 Solving the Morris-Lecar Model To solve the Morris-Lecar Model, we wrote our own code in MatLab. We started by inputting the given dimensional values, listed before. Next, we assigned those given dimensional values to the non-dimensional parameters.\\n4.3.1 Non-dimensional Variables and Parameters In this project, the ﬁrst task was to ﬁnd a non-dimensional representation of the Morris-Lecar equations in terms of variables: • v = V VCa • t = gKT 2Cm • w = W 21 To go along with these given variables, we realized that we assign the following parameters to ﬁnd the non-dimensional representation: V1 = VCa v2 V2 = v1 v2 V3 = vCa v4 V4 = v3 v4 V5 = vK vCa V6 = vL v(Ca) a = gCa gK b = 2∗gL gK c = 2 gK∗vCa d = θ∗gK 2∗Cm Also, we needed to substitute in non-dimensional functions a list of the non-dimensional functions used in the non-dimensional equations: • M∞= 1 21 + tanh(V1V −V2) • W∞= 1 + tanh( V3V −V4 2 ) • l = cosh( V3V −V4 2 ) After we reassigned the values of the origin\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n--- SOURCE 9: Hodgkin-Huxley and Fitzhugh-Nagumo Models - Differential Equation ... ---\\nURL: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118705292.ch4\\n\\nSUMMARY:\\nThis website utilizes technologies such as cookies to enable essential site functionality, as well as for analytics, personalization, and targeted advertising.

Null clines for the FitzHugh–Nagumo model (7.39) with different applied currents Ia. Cases (a), where Ia < I1, and (c), where Ia > I2, have linearly stable, but excitable, steady states, while in (b), where I1 < Ia < I2, the steady state can be unstable and limit cycle periodic solutions are possible.\\n\\nFULL CONTENT:\\n7.5 FitzHugh–Nagumo Model 239 7.5 Hodgkin–Huxley Theory of Nerve Membranes: FitzHugh–Nagumo Model Neural communication is clearly a very important ﬁeld. We make no attempt here to give other than a basic introduction to it and discuss one of the key mathematical models which has been studied extensively. Rinzel (1981) gives a short review of models in neurobiology; see also Keener and Sneyd (1998).\\nElectric signalling or ﬁring by individual nerve cells or neurons is particularly com-mon. The seminal and now classical work by Hodgkin and Huxley (1952) on this aspect of nerve membranes was on the nerve axon of the giant squid. (They were awarded a Nobel prize for their work.) Basically the axon is a long cylindrical tube which extends from each neuron and electrical signals propagate along its outer membrane, about 50 to 70 ˚ Angstr¨ oms thick. The electrical pulses arise because the membrane is preferentially permeable to various chemical ions with the permeabilities affected by the currents and potentials present. The key elements in the system are potassium (K+) ions and sodium (Na+) ions. In the rest state there is a transmembrane potential difference of about −70 millivolts (mV) due to the higher concentration of K+ ions within the axon as compared with the surrounding medium. The deviation in the potential across the membrane, mea-sured from the rest state, is a primary observable in experiments. The membrane per-meability properties change when subjected to a stimulating electrical current I: they also depend on the potential. Such a current can be generated, for example, by a local depolarisation relative to the rest state.\\nIn this section we are concerned with the space-clamped dynamics of the system; that is, we consider the spatially homogeneous dynamics of the membrane. With a real axon the space-clamped state can be obtained experimentally by having a wire down the middle of the axon maintained at a ﬁxed potential difference to the outside. Later, in Chapter 1, Volume II, we shall discuss the important spatial propagation of action potential impulses along the nerve axon; we shall refer back to the model we discuss here. We derive here the Hodgkin–Huxley (1952) model and the reduced analytically tractable FitzHugh–Nagumo mathematical model (FitzHugh 1961, Nagumo et al. 1962) which captures the key phenomena. The analysis of the various mathematical models has indicated phenomena which have motivated considerable experimental work. The theory of neuron ﬁring and propagation of nerve action potentials is one of the major successes of real mathematical biology.\\nBasic Mathematical Model Let us take the positive direction for the membrane current, denoted by I, to be out-wards from the axon. The current I (t) is made up of the current due to the individual ions which pass through the membrane and the contribution from the time variation in the transmembrane potential, that is, the membrane capacitance contribution. Thus we have I (t) = C dv dt + Ii, (7.35) 240 7. Biological Oscillators and Switches where C is the capacitance and Ii is the current contribution from the ion movement across the membrane. Based on experimental observation Hodgkin and Huxley (1952) took Ii = INa + IK + IL, = gNam3h(V −VNa) + gK n4(V −VK ) + gL(V −VL), (7.36) where V is the potential and INa, IK and IL are respectively the sodium, potassium and ‘leakage’ currents; IL is the contribution from all the other ions which contribute to the current. The g’s are constant conductances with, for example, gNam3h the sodium conductance, and VNa, VK and VL are constant equilibrium potentials. The m, n and h are variables, bounded by 0 and 1, which are determined by the differential equations dm dt = αm(V )(1 −m) −βm(V )m, dn dt = αn(V)(1 −n) −βn(V )n, dh dt = αh(V )(1 −h) −βh(V)h, (7.37) where the α and β are given functions of V (again empirically determined by ﬁtting the results to the data); see, for example, Keener and Sneyd (1998). αn and αm are qualitatively like (1+tanh V )/2 while αh(V ) is qualitatively like (1−tanh V )/2, which is a ‘turn-off’ switch if V is moderately large. Hodgkin and Huxley (1952) ﬁtted the data with exponential forms.\\nIf an applied current Ia(t) is imposed the governing equation using (7.35) becomes C dV dt = −gNam3h(V −VNa) −gK n4(V −VK ) −gL(V −VL) + Ia.\\n(7.38) The system (7.38) with (7.37) constitute the 4-variable model which was solved numer-ically by Hodgkin and Huxley (1952).\\nIf Ia = 0, the rest state of the model (7.37) and (7.38) is linearly stable but is excitable in the sense discussed in Chapter 6. That is, if the perturbation from the steady state is sufﬁciently large there is a large excursion of the variables in their phase space before returning to the steady state. If Ia ̸= 0 there is a range of values where regular repetitive ﬁring occurs; that is, the mechanism displays limit cycle characteristics. Both types of phenomena have been observed experimentally. Because of the complexity of the equation system various simpler mathematical models, which capture the key features of the full system, have been proposed, the best known and particularly useful one of which is the FitzHugh–Nagumo model (FitzHugh 1961, Nagumo et al. 1962), which we now derive.\\nThe timescales for m, n and h in (7.37) are not all of the same order. The timescale for m is much faster than the others, so it is reasonable to assume it is sufﬁciently fast that it relaxes immediately to its value determined by setting dm/dt = 0 in (7.37). If we also set h = h0, a constant, the system still retains many of the features experi-7.5 FitzHugh–Nagumo Model 241 Figure 7.11. Phase plane for the model system (7.39) with Ia = 0. As the parameters vary there can be (a) one stable, but excitable state or, (b) three possible steady states, one unstable, namely, S1, and two stable, but excitable, namely, (0, 0) and S2.\\nmentally observed. The resulting 2-variable model in V and n can then be qualitatively approximated by the dimensionless system dv dt = f (v) −w + Ia, dw dt = bv −γ w, f (v) = v(a −v)(v −1), (7.39) where 0 < a < 1 and b and γ are positive constants. Here v is like the membrane potential V , and w plays the role of all three variables m, n and h in (7.37).\\nWith Ia = 0, or just a constant, the system (7.39) is simply a 2-variable phase plane system, the null clines for which are illustrated in Figure 7.11. Note how the Figure 7.12. (a) The phase portrait for (7.39) with Ia = 0, a = 0.25, b = γ = 2 × 10−3 which exhibits the threshold behaviour. With a perturbation from the steady state v = w = 0 to a point, P say, where w = 0, v < a, the trajectory simply returns to the origin with v and w remaining small. A perturbation to A initiates a large excursion along ABCD and then back to (0, 0), effectively along the null cline since b and γ are small.\\n(b) The time variation of v and w corresponding to the excitable trajectory ABC D0 in (a). (Redrawn from Rinzel 1981) 242 7. Biological Oscillators and Switches phase portrait varies with different values of the parameters a, b and γ . There can, for example, be 1 or 3 steady states as shown in Figures 7.11(a) and (b) respectively. The situation corresponds to that illustrated in Figure 7.5, except that here it is possible for v to be negative—it is an electric potential. The excitability characteristic, a key feature in the Hodgkin–Huxley system, is now quite evident. That is, a perturbation, for example, from 0 to a point on the v-axis with v > a, undergoes a large phase trajectory excursion before returning to 0. Figure 7.12 shows a speciﬁc example.\\nPeriodic Neuron Firing With Ia = 0 the possible phase portraits, as illustrated in Figure 7.11, show there can be no periodic solutions (see Section 7.3). Suppose now that there is an applied current Ia. The corresponding null clines for (7.39) are illustrated in Figures 7.13(a) to (c) for several Ia > 0. The effect on the null clines is simply to move the v null cline, with Ia = 0, up the w-axis. With parameter values such that the null clines are as in Figure 7.13(a) we can see that by varying only Ia there is a window of applied currents (I1, I2) where the steady state can be unstable and limit cycle oscillations possible, that is, a null cline situation like that in Figure 7.13(b). The algebra to determine the various parameter ranges for a, b, γ and Ia for each of these various possibilities to hold is straightforward. It is just an exercise in elementary analytical geometry, and is left as an exercise (Exercise 7). With the situation exhibited in Figure 7.13(d) limit cycle solutions are not possible. On the other hand this form can exhibit switch properties.\\nThe FitzHugh–Nagumo model (7.39) is a model of the Hodgkin–Huxley model.\\nSo, a further simpliﬁcation of the mechanism (7.39) is not unreasonable if it simpliﬁes the analysis or makes the various solution possibilities simpler to see. Of course such a simpliﬁcation must retain the major elements of the original, so care must be exercised.\\nFigure 7.13. Null clines for the FitzHugh–Nagumo model (7.39) with different applied currents Ia. Cases (a), where Ia < I1, and (c), where Ia > I2, have linearly stable, but excitable, steady states, while in (b), where I1 < Ia < I2, the steady state can be unstable and limit cycle periodic solutions are possible. With the conﬁguration (d), the steady states S1, S3 are stable with S2 unstable. Here a perturbation from either S1 or S3 can effect a switch to the other.\\n7.5 FitzHugh–Nagumo Model 243 Figure 7.14. (a) Phase plane null clines for a piecewise linear approximation to the v null cline in the FitzHugh–Nagumo model (7.30) with Ia = 0, where (v1, w1) and (v2, w2) are given by (7.40). (b) The geometric conditions for possible periodic solutions, which require Ia > 0, are shown in terms of the angle θ = tan−1[(w2 −w1)/(v2 −v1)]. (c) Geometric conditions for multiple roots and threshold switch possibilities from one steady state S1 to S3 and vice versa.\\nFrom Figure 7.11 we can reasonably approximate the v null cline by a piecewise linear approximation as in Figure 7.14, which in Figure 7.14(a) has zeros at v = 0, a, 1. The positions of the minimum and maximum, (v1, w1) and (v2, w2) are obtained from (7.39) as v2, v1 = 1 3 \\x02 a + 1 ± \\x10 (a + 1)2 −3a \\x111/2\\x03 , wi = −vi(a −vi)(1 −vi) + Ia, i = 1, 2.\\n(7.40) The line from (v1, w1) to (v2, w2) passes through v = a if a = 1/2. The acute angle θ the null cline makes with the v-axis in Figure 7.14 is given by θ = tan−1 \\x02w2 −w1 v2 −v1 \\x03 .\\n(7.41) We can now write down very simply a necessary condition for limit cycle oscil-lations for the piecewise model, that is, conditions for the null clines to be as in Fig-ure 7.14(b). The gradient of the v null cline at the steady state must be less than the gradient, b/γ , of the w null cline; that is, tan θ = w2 −w1 v2 −v1 < b γ .\\n(7.42) Sufﬁcient conditions for a limit cycle solution to exist are obtained by applying the re-sults of Section 7.3 and demonstrating that a conﬁned set exists. Analytical expressions for the limits on the applied current Ia for limit cycles can also be found (Exercise 7).\\nA major property of this model for the space-clamped axon membrane is that it can generate regular beating of a limit cycle nature when the applied current Ia is in an appropriate range I1 < Ia < I2. The bifurcation to a limit cycle solution when Ia increases past I1 is essentially a Hopf bifurcation and so the period of the limit cycle is given by an application of the Hopf bifurcation theorem. This model with periodic 244 7. Biological Oscillators and Switches beating solutions will be referred to again in Chapter 9 when we consider the effect of perturbations on the oscillations. All of the solution behaviour found with the model (7.39) have also been found in the full Hodgkin–Huxley model, numerically of course.\\nThe various solution properties have also been demonstrated experimentally.\\nSome neuron cells ﬁre with periodic bursts of oscillatory activity like that illustrated in Figures 7.7(b) and (d). We would expect such behaviour if we considered coupled neuronal cells which independently undergo continuous ﬁring. By modifying the above model to incorporate other ions, such as a calcium (Ca++) current, periodic bursting is obtained; see Plant (1978, 1981). There are now several neural phenomena where periodic bursts of ﬁring are observed experimentally. With the knowledge we now have of the qualitative nature of the terms and solution behaviour in the above models and some of their possible modiﬁcations, we can now build these into other models to reﬂect various observations which indicate similar phenomena. The ﬁeld of neural signalling, both temporal and spatial, is a fascinating and important one which will be an area of active research for many years.\\n7.6 Modelling the Control of Testosterone Secretion and Chemical Castration The hormone testosterone, although present in very small quantities in the blood, is an extremely important hormone; any regular imbalance can cause dramatic changes.\\nIn man, the blood levels of testosterone can ﬂuctuate periodically with periods of the order of two to three hours. In this section we discuss the physiology of testosterone production and construct and analyse a model, rather different from those we have so far discussed in this chapter, to try and explain the periodic levels of testosterone observed.\\nAlthough the phenomenon is interesting in its own right, another reason for discussing it is to demonstrate the procedure used to analyse this type of model. Perhaps most important, however, is to try and understand the mechanism of production with a view to aiding current research in controlling testosterone production in its use in (chemical) male contraception and prostate cancer control.\\nBefore describing the important physiological elements in the process of testos-terone production, there are some interesting effects and ideas associated with this im-portant hormone. Men have a testosterone level of between 10 to 35 nanomoles per litre of blood, with women having between 0.7 to 2.7 nanomoles per litre. Reduced levels of testosterone, or rather the level of a sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) directly re-lated to free testosterone, are often accompanied by personality changes—the individual tends to become less forceful and commanding. On the other hand increased levels of testosterone induce the converse. Although the actual differences in testosterone levels are minute, the effects can be major.\\nIn men the high level of testosterone primarily comes from the testes, which pro-duces about 90%, with the rest from other parts of the endocrine system, which is why women also produce it. The drug Goserelin, for example, which was introduced to treat cancer of the prostate, can achieve chemical castration within a few weeks after the start of treatment. The patient’s testosterone level is reduced to what would be achieved by removal of the testes. The body does not seem to adjust to the drug and so effective 7.6 Testosterone Secretion and Chemical Castration 245 castration continues only as long as the treatment is maintained. How the drug works in blocking the production of testosterone is pointed out below when we discuss the physiological production process. Enthusiasm for sex, or sex drive, depends on many factors and not only the level of testosterone, which certainly plays a very signiﬁcant role. If we consider the problem of an excessive sex drive, it is not uncommon for men sentenced for rape to ask to be treated with drugs to induce castration. There are now several drugs which effect castration: the already mentioned Goserelin, such as Lupron and Depo-provera which is more long lasting. The use of drugs to suppress the production of testosterone has been used in Europe for more than 10 years. In fact it is often a condition of release for convicted sex offenders. In Europe Depo-provera has reduced the recidivism rate of child molesters to 2% whereas in the U.S., where drugs are not generally used it is of the order of 50%. The role of testosterone-reducing drugs, or generally chemical castration, is a controversial area of treatment for sex of-fenders.\\nThe full physiological process is not yet fully understood although there is general agreement on certain key elements. The following shows how a ﬁrst model had to be modiﬁed to incorporate key physiological facts and points the way to more recent and complex models. We ﬁrst derive a model for testosterone (T) production in the male suggested by Smith (1980); it is based on accepted basic experimental facts. We then discuss a modiﬁcation which results in a delay model which incorporates more realistic physiology associated with the spatial separation of the various control regions. A more complicated delay model which is consistent with a wider range of experiments was proposed by Cartwright and Husain (1986): it incorporates more of the physiological process. We discuss it very brieﬂy below.\\nLet us now consider the basic physiology. The secretion of testosterone from the gonads is stimulated by a pituitary hormone called the luteinising hormone (LH). The secretion of LH from the pituitary gland is stimulated by the luteinising hormone releas-ing hormone (LHRH). This LHRH is normally secreted by the hypothalmus (part of the third ventricle in the brain) and carried to the pituitary gland by the blood. Testosterone is believed to have a feedback effect on the secretion of LH and LHRH. Based on these, Smith (1980) proposed a simple negative feedback compartment model, such as we dis-cussed in Section 7.2, involving the three hormones T, LH and LHRH and represented schematically in Figure 7.15.\\nDenote the concentrations of the LHRH, LH and T respectively by R(t), L(t) and T(t). At the simplest modelling level we consider each of the hormones to be cleared from the bloodstream according to ﬁrst-order kinetics with LH and T produced by their precursors according to ﬁrst-order kinetics. There is a nonlinear negative feedback by T(t) on R(t). The governing system reﬂecting this scheme is essentially the model feedback system (7.3), which here is written as d R dt = f (T) −b1R, dL dt = g1R −b2L, dT dt = g2L −b3T, (7.43)\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n'}}\n",

The Morris-Lecar (ML) model is another two-variable system, offering a more biophysically realistic simplification than FHN, with equations describing ionic currents [7, 8]. The Prescott model, a variant of Morris-Lecar, explicitly includes a slow adaptation variable ($z$) and various adaptation currents like voltage-gated K+ current, affecting threshold dynamics [9].\\n\\n### Sources\\n[1] Hodgkin–Huxley model - Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin–Huxley_model\\n[2] PDF: https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~gucken/PDF/hh_twist.pdf\\n[3] 2.2 Hodgkin-Huxley Model | Neuronal Dynamics online book: https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S2.html\\n[4] PDF: https://goldmanlab.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/263/2016/07/HodgkinHuxley.pdf\\n[5] Biophysical mechanism of spike threshold dependence on the rate of rise ...: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23344915/\\n[6] Fitzhugh-Nagumo Model - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics: https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/fitzhugh-nagumo-model\\n[7] PDF: https://www.math.fsu.edu/~bertram/lectures/neural_dynamics.pdf\\n[8] PDF: https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1134/S2070048217030036.pdf?pdf=button\\n[9] Contributions of adaptation currents to dynamic spike threshold on slow ...: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1007570416304154', 'description': 'This section lists and describes canonical or widely cited governing equations for biophysical neuron models, such as the Hodgkin-Huxley model and its simplified variants, providing their mathematical forms and roles in describing neuronal activity.', 'name': 'Background Equations', 'research': True}], 'source_str': 'Search results: \\n\\n\\n\\n--- SOURCE 1: Biophysical Basis for Three Distinct Dynamical Mechanisms of Action ... ---\\nURL: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23310491_Biophysical_Basis_for_Three_Distinct_Dynamical_Mechanisms_of_Action_Potential_Initiation\\n\\nSUMMARY:\\nClass 3 excitability occurs through a quasi-separatrix crossing when fast-activating inward current overpowers slow-activating outward current during a stimulus transient, although slow-activating\\n\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n--- SOURCE 2: Biophysical mechanism of spike threshold dependence on the rate of rise ... ---\\nURL: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23344915/\\n\\nSUMMARY:\\nThreshold is variable, and in many types of neurons there is a relationship between the threshold voltage and the rate of rise of the membrane potential (dVm/dt) leading to the spike.

Threshold is variable, and in many types of neurons there is a relationship between the threshold voltage and the rate of rise of the membrane potential (dVm/dt) leading to the spike. In primary sensory cortex this relationship enhances the sensitivity of neurons to a particular stimulus feature. While Na⁺ channel inactivation may contribute to this relationship, recent evidence indicates that K⁺ currents located in the spike initiation zone are crucial. Here we used a simple Hodgkin-Huxley biophysical model to systematically investigate the role of K⁺ and Na⁺ current parameters (activation voltages and kinetics) in regulating spike threshold as a function of dVm/dt. Threshold was determined empirically and not estimated from the shape of the Vm prior to a spike. This allowed us to investigate intrinsic currents and values of gating variables at the precise voltage threshold. We found that Na⁺ nactivation is sufficient to produce the relationship provided it occurs at hyperpolarized voltages combined with slow kinetics. Alternatively, hyperpolarization of the K⁺ current activation voltage, even in the absence of Na⁺ inactivation, is also sufficient to produce the relationship. This hyperpolarized shift of K⁺ activation allows an outward current prior to spike initiation to antagonize the Na⁺ inward current such that it becomes self-sustaining at a more depolarized voltage. Our simulations demonstrate parameter constraints on Na⁺ inactivation and the biophysical mechanism by which an outward current regulates spike threshold as a function of dVm/dt.\\n\\n[PubMed Disclaimer](/disclaimer/)\\n\\n## Figures\\n\\n![Fig. 1](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/59c1/3683126/49ce365dd0e9/nihms-438865-f0001.gif)\\n\\nFig. 1\\n\\nTraub (default) model of the…\\n\\nFig. 1\\n\\nTraub (default) model of the Na  +  and K  +  currents used in…\\n\\n![Fig. 2](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/59c1/3683126/022c24d625a5/nihms-438865-f0002.gif)\\n\\nFig. 2\\n\\nSimulation design.

Here we use conductance-based models to investigate how the activation of three adaptation currents regulates the [threshold voltage](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/threshold-voltage \"Learn more about threshold voltage from ScienceDirect\\'s AI-generated Topic Pages\") for action potential (AP) initiation during the course of SFA. It is observed that the spike threshold gets depolarized and the rate of membrane depolarization (d _V_/d _t_) preceding AP is reduced as adaptation currents reduce firing rate. It is indicated that the presence of inhibitory adaptation currents enables the neuron to generate a dynamic threshold inversely correlated with preceding d _V_/d _t_ on slower timescales than fast dynamics of AP generation. By analyzing the interactions of ionic currents at subthreshold potentials, we find that the activation of adaptation currents increase the outward level of net membrane current prior to AP initiation, which antagonizes inward Na+ to result in a depolarized threshold and lower d _V_/d _t_ from one AP to the next. Our simulations demonstrate that the threshold dynamics on slow timescales is a secondary effect caused by the activation of adaptation currents. These findings have provided a biophysical interpretation of the relationship between adaptation currents and spike threshold.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n------------\\n\\nNeurons in the central nervous system (CNS) have powerful capability to process the receiving information underlying perception or motor control. They are able to accurately encode and transmit various spatiotemporal signals by initiating specific sequences of action potentials (APs). One common strategy used by CNS neurons to shape AP trains is the spike-frequency adaptation (SFA), which refers to the gradual reduction of an initially high firing rate to a lower steady-state level during sustained stimulus. Earlier studies have shown that the SFA induced by various adaptation currents plays considerable roles in neural coding, such as signal extraction [1], forward masking [2], [3], response selectivity [4], [5], [6], high-pass filtering [1], [3], [7], [8], noise shaping and precise temporal coding [9], which endows the neuron with a flexible function under varying conditions. Using neuron models with adaptation currents to investigate how the ionic mechanisms underlying SFA participate in AP initiation is therefore an essential step towards a mechanistic understanding of how SFA contributes to the coding strategies of a neuron.\\n\\nSFA is typically attributed to the slowly hyperpolarizing currents, which are directly or indirectly activated during the APs. Two common types of them include M-type current (_I_ M) [10], [11] and AHP-type current (_I_ AHP) [3], [12], [13]. _I_ M is a voltage-gated K+ current mediated by KCNQ channels. It activates at the potentials below firing threshold [9], [11], [14], and does not rely on AP generation. _I_ AHP is a Ca 2+-gated K+ current, which is activated primarily by the increase in intracellular concentration of Ca 2+ due to the influx of Ca 2+ through voltage-activated Ca 2+ channels [3], [9], [12], [13]. The relevant Ca 2+ channels are activated at high voltages above firing threshold, which makes the activation of _I_ AHP dependent on the generation of APs. Another adaptation current is the Na+-activated K+ current, i.e., _I_ KNa [15]. It is instantaneously gated by the intracellular concentration of Na+, which can also result in SFA on a much longer timescale. Generally, these inhibitory currents all include a form of slow negative feedback to the excitability of the cell. Their activation usually occurs at a slower timescale than the dynamics of spike generation, which builds up from one AP to the next and then gradually reduces firing rate to constant stimulus.\\n\\nThere is a large variety of single-compartment models used in computational neuroscience to simulate the APs [16], [17], which range from integrate-and-fire (IF) models to various conductance-based models. The former have simplest model forms for spiking activity. In IF model, the AP is emitted when membrane potential exceeds a preset threshold. The common conductance-based models are Hodgkin–Huxley like models, which have more biophysical details than IF neurons. The initiation of APs in these models results from the nonlinear interactions of inward and outward currents at the voltages below firing threshold, i.e., subthreshold. By incorporating various adaptation currents in these single-compartment models, the adaptive behaviors of neurons observed in experiments have been phenomenologically reproduced. Simultaneously, the effects of SFA on the information transmission of neurons have been extensively studied.\\n\\nFor IF model neurons, an alternative way to generate SFA is incorporating a dynamic spike threshold that is incremented by each AP in the model. Earlier theoretical studies [8], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25] have shown that a dynamic threshold is sufficient to lead IF neurons to adapt their response frequency. With such models, the physiologically observed SFA, such as gradually reduced firing rate and negative correlations of interspike intervals (ISIs), has been successfully reproduced. In particular, Liu and Wang [19] compared two methods for reproducing SFA in IF neurons, i.e., adaptation currents and dynamic threshold. They found that there are subtle differences between them when regarding the dependence of either ISI variability or adaptation time constant on input current. A later study by Lindner and Longtin [25] further supports the similarity between two methods. However, Benda et al. [8] recently reported that the adaptation currents have qualitatively different effects on the transfer function of neurons than that of dynamic threshold. These modeling studies that focus on the input-output properties of a neuron lead to the controversy whether the adaptation mechanism should be modeled as a dynamic threshold or as an adaptation current. Is the dynamic spike threshold a possible mechanism for SFA, or just a secondary effect of the activation of adaptation currents?\\n\\nTo address above questions, it requires knowledge of the relationship between adaptation currents and spike threshold. It is known that CNS neurons initiate APs when their membrane voltage exceeds a threshold level [26], [27], i.e., spike threshold. After that, the depolarizing Na+ becomes self-sustaining and drives membrane potential to produce the fast upstroke of the spike. Experiments have shown that the AP threshold is not constant but dynamic [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], which varies with both firing history and synaptic input. In particular, it is inversely correlated with the rate of membrane depolarization, i.e., d _V_/d _t_, preceding AP initiation [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32]. To determine the relationship between adaptation currents and threshold dynamics, we investigate how the activation of adaptation currents impacts the dependence of threshold voltage on the preceding d _V_/d _t_ in present study.\\n\\nHere we use conductance-based models with adaptation currents to simulate SFA. The threshold voltage for AP initiation during the course of SFA is determined by the first derivative method [27], [28], [33] that is widely used in experiments. Instead of characterizing input-output properties, we focus on how adaptation currents interact with depolarizing Na+ at the subthreshold potentials to contribute to the dynamic threshold. These investigations provide a biophysical interpretation of how the intrinsically generated SFA regulates the threshold voltage for AP initiation on slow timescales.\\n\\nSection snippets\\n----------------\\n\\nPrescott model\\n--------------\\n\\nThe Prescott model is a single-compartment conductance-based model, which is proposed by introducing adaptation currents to the Morris-Lecar like model [9], [34]. Its state is determined by three dynamical variables, which are membrane potential _V_, K+ gating variable _w_, and adaptation variable _z_. The system is described as follows [9], [34] d V d t=I ext−I Na−I K−I adapt−I L C m d w d t=φ w w∞(V)−w τ w(V)d z d t=z∞(V)−z τ z where C m is membrane capacitance, _I_ ext is external stimulus, and ϕ _w_ is the scale parameter of\\n\\nSpike threshold in Prescott model without adaptation currents\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWe start with the Prescott model that is not introduced adaptation currents, i.e., g¯adapt=0 mS/c m 2 in Eq.

Before investigating the energy and information problems of neurons, we discuss the effects of varying the intensity of different inter-chamber conductance, dendritic stimulation current magnitude, axon area to total area ratio, and temperature on the firing patterns of a single neuron.   Show abstract The physiological structure of the brain and the morphology of its neurons result from selective pressure, the nervous system must be energy efficient. In this paper, a two compartment model consisting of dendritic and axon compartments is proposed to simulate the effects of morphology and temperature on neuronal kinetics. Based on the equivalent circuit method, we calculated the metabolic energy consumption of neurons with morphological and temperature variations. It is shown that higher temperatures increase the separation of Na+ and K+ currents in the axon, resulting in higher energy efficiency, while neuron with moderate morphological parameter is more likely to fire, but accompanied by a higher energy cost. We integrate this two-compartment model into a feedforward network to simulate changes in network energy consumption affected by neuron morphology and temperature during information propagation. It is found that moderate temperature and morphology allow stable propagation of synchronization spikes in the feedforward network and maximize the energy utilization for information transmission. In addition, we present a simple statistical method to detect the robustness of network information transmission. This paper may provide some insights for further studies on energy consumption in the cerebral cortex.    \\n*   ### [Variability and Significance of Spike Threshold in Neurons](https://doi.org/10.16476/j.pibb.2021.0255)\\n\\n2022, Progress in Biochemistry and Biophysics     \\n*   ### [Metabolic consumption of information coding by single neurons: Action potential and energy efficiency](https://doi.org/10.16476/j.pibb.2020.0300)\\n\\n2021, Progress in Biochemistry and Biophysics     \\n\\n[View full text](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1007570416304154)\\n\\n© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

It has been proposed that threshold variability measured in vivo reflects an adaptation of the spike threshold to the membrane potential, due to the inactivation of sodium channels – or the activation of potassium channels , . To address this issue and demonstrate that the spiking criterion (and not just the measured voltage at the upstroke of spikes) adapts to the membrane potential, we used a generalization of a model of threshold adaptation based on sodium channel inactivation  to predict the occurrence and timing of spikes.\\n\\nFULL CONTENT:\\nSpike-Threshold Adaptation Predicted by Membrane Potential Dynamics In Vivo - PMC \\n\\n===============\\n[Skip to main content](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#main-content)\\n\\n![Image 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/us_flag.svg)\\n\\nAn official website of the United States government\\n\\nHere\\'s how you know\\n\\nHere\\'s how you know\\n\\n![Image 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-dot-gov.svg)\\n\\n**Official websites use .gov**\\n\\n A **.gov** website belongs to an official government organization in the United States.\\n\\n![Image 3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/static/img/icon-https.svg)\\n\\n**Secure .gov websites use HTTPS**\\n\\n A **lock** ( ) or **https://** means you\\'ve safely connected to the .gov website.

Threshold variability could be explained by adaptation to the membrane potential. However, it could also be the case that most threshold variability reflects noise and processes other than threshold adaptation. Here, we investigated threshold variation in auditory neurons responses recorded _in vivo_ in barn owls. We found that spike threshold is quantitatively predicted by a model in which the threshold adapts, tracking the membrane potential at a short timescale. As a result, in these neurons, slow voltage fluctuations do not contribute to spiking because they are filtered by threshold adaptation. More importantly, these neurons can only respond to input spikes arriving together on a millisecond timescale. These results demonstrate that fast adaptation to the membrane potential captures spike threshold variability _in vivo_.\\n\\nAuthor Summary\\n--------------\\n\\nNeurons spike when their membrane potential exceeds a threshold value, but this value has been shown to be variable in the same neuron recorded _in vivo_. This variability could reflect noise, or deterministic processes that make the threshold vary with the membrane potential. The second alternative would have important functional consequences. Here, we show that threshold variability is a genuine feature of neurons, which reflects adaptation to the membrane potential at a short timescale, with little contribution from noise. This demonstrates that a deterministic model can predict spikes based only on the membrane potential.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n------------\\n\\nNeurons encode information in sequences of stereotypical action potentials or spikes. Spikes are all-or-none voltage deflections triggered when the membrane potential of a neuron crosses a threshold. _In vivo_, the spiking threshold, as measured as the voltage at the upstroke of spikes, varies with firing history and input properties. This phenomenon has been widely observed in the central nervous system, e.g. visual cortex [[1]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi.1003560-Azouz1), [[2]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi.1003560-Azouz2), auditory midbrain [[3]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi.1003560-Pea1), hippocampus [[4]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi.1003560-Henze1), somatosensory cortex [[5]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi.1003560-Wilent1). It has been proposed that threshold variability measured in vivo reflects an adaptation of the spike threshold to the membrane potential, due to the inactivation of sodium channels [[6]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi.1003560-Kuba1)–[[8]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi.1003560-Platkiewicz1) or the activation of potassium channels [[9]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi.1003560-Higgs1), [[10]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi.1003560-Goldberg1). Threshold adaptation would have a profound influence on how the combined input of a neuron is encoded in the spiking output [[5]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi.1003560-Wilent1), [[6]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi.1003560-Kuba1), [[11]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi.1003560-Reyes1)–[[14]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi.1003560-Fontaine1), such as enhancing coincidence detection [[1]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi.1003560-Azouz1), [[2]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi.1003560-Azouz2), improving feature selectivity [[5]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi.1003560-Wilent1) and temporal coding in sensory neurons [[15]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi.1003560-Kuba2). However, previous studies _in vivo_ only reported correlations suggestive of threshold adaptation. Other authors have suggested that threshold variability observed _in vivo_ could also reflect measurement artifacts because spikes are initiated at the axon initial segment but measured at the soma [[16]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi.1003560-Yu1). Threshold variability could also be due to channel noise [[17]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi.1003560-White1), slow changes in excitability [[18]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi.1003560-Grubb1) or modulation by axonal synapses [[19]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi.1003560-Howard2). More generally the voltage measured at the upstroke of spikes may be a poor estimate of the actual criterion for spiking (which could depend on unobserved quantities). The goal of this study was to determine whether threshold variability observed _in vivo_ is mainly due to threshold adaptation to the membrane potential, or to one of the alternative hypotheses.\\n\\nUnfortunately, this question cannot be entirely addressed _in vitro_, where inputs are better controlled. First, there are potential sources of threshold variability _in vivo_ that do not exist in vitro; in particular, noise and synaptic inputs to the initial segment. Second, properties of Na channels are likely to be different _in vivo_. Indeed, Na channels can be modulated in various ways, including their peak conductance and both the time constant and voltage-dependence of inactivation [[20]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi.1003560-Catterall1). Therefore, results _in vitro_ may not readily extend to _in vivo_ conditions.\\n\\nIn this work we studied the dynamics of the spiking threshold in neurons of the barn owl\\'s external nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICx) _in vivo_. While the spatial tuning [[21]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi.1003560-Knudsen1), [[22]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi.1003560-Moiseff1) and the underlying computations in ICx neurons have been investigated [[23]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi.1003560-Takahashi1)–[[25]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi.1003560-Pea3), previous studies have shown wide variation in spiking threshold over the stimulus duration [[3]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi.1003560-Pea1). To understand this variability, we fitted a mechanistic model of spike threshold adaptation that generalizes a model based on sodium-channel inactivation [[26]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi.1003560-Platkiewicz2) to intracellular recordings _in vivo_. The model is used to test whether it is possible to accurately predict spiking from the membrane potential history. If threshold variability is due to noise, then this prediction should fail; if it is due to factors other than adaptation (for example phosphorylation of Na channels, or GABA inputs onto the initial segment), then the parameter values of the fitted model should depend on the stimulus.\\n\\nThe model was able to predict spikes with high accuracy and to account for most observed variance in measured threshold. In addition, it allowed us to estimate the threshold at all times, including between spikes. We found that the spike threshold tracks the membrane potential at a shorter time scale than the membrane time constant. The “effective signal” for spike initiation is then best defined as the difference between threshold and membrane potential. Fast threshold adaptation has two major functional consequences: 1) the effective signal is less variable than the membrane potential, because low frequency components of the input are filtered out; 2) the neuron can only respond to inputs with dynamics faster than the adaptation timescale, an order of magnitude lower than the membrane time constant. These findings show that most threshold variability observed _in vivo_ in these neurons can be explained by fast adaptation to the membrane potential.\\n\\nResults\\n-------\\n\\n### Spike threshold depends on preceding membrane potential\\n\\nNeurons of the barn owl\\'s ICx are selective to sound direction [[21]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi.1003560-Knudsen1), by combining tuning to interaural time (ITDs) and intensity differences (IIDs) [[22]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi.1003560-Moiseff1), [[23]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi.1003560-Takahashi1).

Spike thresholds ([Fig. 1b](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi-1003560-g001)) were measured using the ![Image 10: Inline graphic](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/9dd2/3983065/a1358d1309b0/pcbi.1003560.e002.jpg) derivative, a procedure known to produce reliable estimates [[27]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi.1003560-Sekerli1). At spike initiation the derivative increases abruptly and the precise value of the criterion makes little difference to the estimated voltage ([Fig. 1c](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi-1003560-g001)). The spike threshold was highly variable, spanning a range of about 8 mV (σ = 3.1±1.1 mV). In fact, the distribution of spike thresholds was so large that it overlapped the ![Image 11: Inline graphic](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/9dd2/3983065/a1358d1309b0/pcbi.1003560.e003.jpg) distribution induced by the input ([Fig. 1d](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi-1003560-g001)).

However, what we called “spike threshold” above is in fact only a measurement of the voltage at the upstroke of spikes. It could be that the relevant criterion for spiking is a quantity (or set of quantities) other than somatic voltage, and that the voltage at the upstroke of spikes is correlated with ![Image 20: Inline graphic](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/9dd2/3983065/a1358d1309b0/pcbi.1003560.e011.jpg) history but has no causal relationship therewith.\\n\\nTo address this issue and demonstrate that the spiking criterion (and not just the measured voltage at the upstroke of spikes) adapts to the membrane potential, we used a generalization of a model of threshold adaptation based on sodium channel inactivation [[8]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi.1003560-Platkiewicz1) to predict the occurrence and timing of spikes. Our goal was to predict spike trains, not the voltage at the upstroke of spikes.\\n\\nAlthough the model was derived from properties of sodium channels, we used it here as a phenomenological model of threshold adaptation, which may also be consistent with other intrinsic mechanisms (see [Discussion](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#s3)).

More generally, the spike threshold is defined as the voltage value at which the neuron would spike if its membrane potential were instantaneously brought above it. Thus it is a threshold in the sense of an explicit spiking criterion, unlike the empirical measurements.

This can be considered as a general first-order model of threshold adaptation. Theory based on the properties of sodium channels predicts that the steady-state threshold is constant below the half-inactivation voltage ![Image 29: Inline graphic](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/9dd2/3983065/c7f16f4820a8/pcbi.1003560.e020.jpg), and increases approximately linearly above it [[8]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi.1003560-Platkiewicz1). However, threshold adaptation can also result from activation of voltage-gated potassium channels [[9]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi.1003560-Higgs1). Therefore, to be more general, we did not impose a constant threshold below ![Image 30: Inline graphic](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/9dd2/3983065/c7f16f4820a8/pcbi.1003560.e021.jpg).

Parameters characterizing the two slopes, the connecting point and the curvature were constrained by the data. Some threshold adaptation models also include an explicit effect of spikes on threshold [[26]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi.1003560-Platkiewicz2), [[28]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi.1003560-Badel1) (the threshold increases after each spike), but it did not appear useful in our case, as we observed no correlation between ISI and spike threshold.\\n\\n#### Figure 2.

However, as argued above, the measured somatic voltage at the upstroke of spikes may not correspond to the spike threshold, in the sense of a criterion for triggering a spike. For example, it has been argued that the relevant criterion should in fact be the voltage value at spike onset in the axon initial segment (AIS), where spikes are initiated [[16]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi.1003560-Yu1), [[29]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi.1003560-Kole1). Even if the somatic voltage at the upstroke of spikes truly corresponded to the spike threshold, there would still be a methodological issue with optimizing the threshold model to predict that voltage. Indeed a trivial solution to the fitting problem is the threshold model defined by ![Image 34: Inline graphic](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/9dd2/3983065/2de574e9ce65/pcbi.1003560.e024.jpg) and ![Image 35: Inline graphic](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/9dd2/3983065/087a79a04ec6/pcbi.1003560.e025.jpg) ms: the “spike threshold” always equals the membrane potential, in particular at the upstroke of spikes.\\n\\nTo avoid these problems, we instead used the threshold model to predict the occurrence of spikes and their precise timing based only on ![Image 36: Inline graphic](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/9dd2/3983065/a1358d1309b0/pcbi.1003560.e026.jpg). The trivial solution mentioned above is a poor predictor of spikes since it would predict too many spikes. The voltage trace was thus passed through the model equation to produce a dynamic spike threshold ([Fig. 2b](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi-1003560-g002)). Theory predicts that a spike should be produced when the voltage trace crosses threshold. The model can fail by producing spikes at the wrong time or by producing extra spikes. To account for both types of errors, we defined a stringent coincidence window (δ = 84 µs) and calculated the proportion of coincident spikes in both the recorded and predicted spike trains. We used the gamma factor ![Image 37: Inline graphic](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/9dd2/3983065/0b70070ebb27/pcbi.1003560.e027.jpg), a normalized coincidence measure that has been used in a number of studies [[30]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi.1003560-Jolivet1)–[[32]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi.1003560-Rossant1). We optimized the model parameters to maximize ![Image 38: Inline graphic](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/9dd2/3983065/0b70070ebb27/pcbi.1003560.e028.jpg) on a given recording, and the model performance was then tested on different recordings in the same cell.\\n\\nWe first checked that this optimization strategy was correct on different neuron models with an explicit adaptive threshold with a time constant of 3–5 ms ([Fig. 2c–e](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi-1003560-g002); see [Materials and Methods](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#s4)). The first model had a fixed threshold ([Fig. 2c](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi-1003560-g002)), the second an adaptive threshold with rectified-linear characteristics (only adapts above ![Image 39: Inline graphic](https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/9dd2/3983065/0cb0f49ed354/pcbi.1003560.e029.jpg); [Fig. 2d](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi-1003560-g002)) and the third a threshold that adapted linearly in the entire voltage range ([Fig. 2e](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983065/#pcbi-1003560-g002)).

Properties of ionic channels are likely to play a role in threshold modulation. We examined in models the influence of Na channel activation, inactivation, slow voltage-gated channels and synaptic conductances on spike threshold. We propose a threshold equation which quantifies the contribution of all these mechanisms. It provides an instantaneous time-varying value of the threshold, which applies to neurons with fluctuating inputs. We deduce a differential equation for the threshold, similar to the equations of gating variables in the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism, which describes how the spike threshold varies with the membrane potential, depending on channel properties. We find that spike threshold depends logarithmically on Na channel density, and that Na channel inactivation and K channels can dynamically modulate it in an adaptive way: the threshold increases with membrane potential and after every action potential. Our equation was validated with simulations of a previously published multicompartemental model of spike initiation. Finally, we observed that threshold variability in models depends crucially on the shape of the Na activation function near spike initiation (about −55 mV), while its parameters are adjusted near half-activation voltage (about −30 mV), which might explain why many models exhibit little threshold variability, contrary to experimental observations. We conclude that ionic channels can account for large variations in spike threshold.\\n\\n## Author Summary\\n\\nNeurons communicate primarily with stereotypical electrical impulses, action potentials, which are fired when a threshold level of excitation is reached. This threshold varies between cells and over time as a function of previous stimulations, which has major functional implications on the integrative properties of neurons. Ionic channels are thought to play a central role in this modulation but the precise relationship between their properties and the threshold is unclear. We examined this relationship in biophysical models and derived a formula which quantifies the contribution of various mechanisms. The originality of our approach is that it provides an instantaneous time-varying value for the threshold, which applies to the highly fluctuating regimes characterizing neurons *in vivo*. In particular, two known ionic mechanisms were found to make the threshold adapt to the membrane potential, thus providing the cell with a form of gain control.\\n\\n**Citation:** Platkiewicz J, Brette R (2010) A Threshold Equation for Action Potential Initiation.

The value of that threshold sets the firing rate and determines the way neurons compute, for example their coincidence detection properties [[1]](#pcbi.1000850-Kempter1), [[2]](#pcbi.1000850-Kuba1). It is generally described as a voltage threshold: spikes are initiated when the neuron is depolarized above a critical value, when voltage-dependent sodium channels start to open. That biophysical mechanism is well understood since the studies of Hodgkin and Huxley in the squid giant axon [[3]](#pcbi.1000850-Hodgkin1) and subsequent modeling studies [[4]](#pcbi.1000850-Fitzhugh1)–[[7]](#pcbi.1000850-Noble1).\\n\\nRecent findings have renewed the interest in the spike threshold. First, there is an intense ongoing debate about the origin of threshold variability observed in vivo [[8]](#pcbi.1000850-Azouz1)–[[14]](#pcbi.1000850-Yu1). In particular, it is unclear whether threshold variability is mainly due to experimental artifacts or molecular mechanisms, which might question the relevance of the Hodgkin-Huxley model for central neurons. Moreover, numerous experiments have shown that spike initiation does not only depend on the membrane potential but also on complex features of the inputs. For example, it depends on the preceding rate of depolarization [[15]](#pcbi.1000850-Azouz2)–[[21]](#pcbi.1000850-Wilent1) and on the preceding interspike intervals [[12]](#pcbi.1000850-Henze1), [[22]](#pcbi.1000850-Badel1). Those properties are functionally important because they enhance the selectivity of neurons in several sensory modalities, in particular in audition [[23]](#pcbi.1000850-Escab1), vision [[24]](#pcbi.1000850-Priebe1), and touch [[21]](#pcbi.1000850-Wilent1).\\n\\nDevelopmental and learning studies have also shown that the threshold adapts to slow changes in input characteristics. This phenomenon is known as long-term plasticity of intrinsic excitability and may be involved in the regulation of cell firing, short term memory and learning [[25]](#pcbi.1000850-Aizenman1)–[[31]](#pcbi.1000850-Zhang1). The excitability threshold also varies with the distance to the soma in a given neuron and with cell type [[2]](#pcbi.1000850-Kuba1), [[15]](#pcbi.1000850-Azouz2), [[32]](#pcbi.1000850-Fried1)–[[35]](#pcbi.1000850-Nowak1), which may explain functional differences.\\n\\nThe modulation of cell excitability might be explained by the activation of voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1 [[36]](#pcbi.1000850-Chi1)–[[41]](#pcbi.1000850-Shu1), inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels [[15]](#pcbi.1000850-Azouz2), [[16]](#pcbi.1000850-Azouz3), [[19]](#pcbi.1000850-Fricker1), [[21]](#pcbi.1000850-Wilent1), fluctuations in sodium channel gating [[42]](#pcbi.1000850-White1), inhibitory synaptic conductance [[43]](#pcbi.1000850-Coombs1)–[[45]](#pcbi.1000850-Qian1) and the site of spike initiation [[14]](#pcbi.1000850-Yu1). To understand the origin of spike threshold variability, we examined the role of several candidate mechanisms in biophysical neuron models: activation and inactivation of the sodium channel, slow voltage-gated channels (e.g. Kv1), synaptic conductances and the site of spike initiation. Our analysis is based on a simplification of the membrane equation near spike initiation and results in a simple formula for the spike threshold that quantifies the contribution of all those mechanisms. The threshold formula provides an instantaneous time-varying value which was found to agree well with numerical simulations of Hodgkin-Huxley type models driven by fluctuating inputs mimicking synaptic activity *in vivo*, and with simulations of a realistic multicompartmental model of spike initiation [[54]](#pcbi.1000850-Hu1).\\n\\n## Results\\n\\n### What is the spike threshold?\\n\\n#### Spike threshold *in vitro*.\\n\\nIn a typical *in vitro* experiment, one measures the response of the cell to a controlled stimulus, whose strength is defined by a parameter (e.g. current intensity). The excitability threshold is then defined as the minimal value of this parameter above which a spike is elicited. Thus, the threshold is initially defined in stimulus space, for example as a charge threshold for short current pulses ([Fig. 1A](#pcbi-1000850-g001), simulated recording) or as a current threshold for current steps or ramps ([Fig. 1B](#pcbi-1000850-g001)). The stimulus threshold corresponds to a voltage value, which we call the *voltage threshold*, but that value depends on the type of stimulation [[46]](#pcbi.1000850-Koch1). Nevertheless, we are interested in the voltage threshold rather than in the stimulus threshold because only the voltage is usually available in intracellular recordings *in vivo*.\\n\\n![thumbnail](article/figure/image?size=inline&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.g001)\\n\\nAll plots were generated using the single-compartment model described in the [Materials and Methods](#s4). A, *In vitro*, the neuron is stimulated with short current pulses with increasing intensity (bottom) and the threshold is the minimal value of that intensity above which the neuron spikes (top). The voltage threshold is the value of the membrane potential at that critical point. B, The threshold can be defined similarly with current steps (bottom) or other types of parameterized stimulations, yielding different values for the voltage threshold. C, *In vivo*, spike “threshold” is defined as a measure of the voltage at the onset of the action potential (black dots). The plot shows a simulated trace of a conductance-based model with fluctuating conductances (see [Materials and Methods](#s4)) and threshold is measured with the first derivative method. D, Representation of the trace in (C) in phase space, showing dV/dt vs. V. The first derivative method consists in measuring the membrane potential V when the derivative crosses a predefined value (dashed line) shortly before an action potential. The trace is superimposed on the excitability curve dV/dt\\u200a=\\u200a(F(V)+I0)/C, which defines the dynamics of the model. I0 is the mean input current, so that trajectories in phase space fluctuate around this excitability curve.\\n\\nAll plots were generated using the single-compartment model described in the [Materials and Methods](#s4).

Rather, it is defined as the voltage at the “onset” of action potentials ([Fig. 1 C](#pcbi-1000850-g001)), as observed on an intracellular recording of the membrane potential. Therefore the spike threshold is an empirical quantity that hopefully captures the same concept as *in vitro*, i.e., the point above which an action potential is initiated. Several measures of spike onset have been used in experimental studies [[47]](#pcbi.1000850-Sekerli1). The first derivative method consists in measuring the membrane potential V when its derivative dV/dt crosses an empirical criterion [[8]](#pcbi.1000850-Azouz1), [[34]](#pcbi.1000850-Kole1) ([Fig. 1D](#pcbi-1000850-g001)). The second and third derivative methods consist in measuring V when respectively d2V/dt2 and d3V/dt3 reach their maximum [[12]](#pcbi.1000850-Henze1), [[21]](#pcbi.1000850-Wilent1). Sekerli et al. (2004) compared those methods by asking electrophysiologists to identify spike onsets by eye on several membrane potential traces [[47]](#pcbi.1000850-Sekerli1). They found that visual inspection was best matched by the first derivative method, although that method critically relies on the choice of the derivative criterion ([Fig. 2 C,D](#pcbi-1000850-g002)). However, all methods produced the same relative variations of the measured threshold.\\n\\n![thumbnail](article/figure/image?size=inline&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.g002)\\n\\nA, Excitability curve of the neuron model (dV/dt\\u200a=\\u200a(F(V)+I)/C; see [Materials and Methods](#s4)) for DC input current I\\u200a=\\u200a0 (solid curve) and ![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e001) (dashed curve).

However, as remarked in [[47]](#pcbi.1000850-Sekerli1), those measures differ in absolute value but they vary in the same way. We can relate those definitions with a simple one-dimensional neuron model, where the membrane potential is governed by a differential equation:![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e010)where C is the membrane capacitance, F(V) is the sum of all intrinsic voltage-dependent currents and I the input current. The dynamics of the membrane potential is determined by the excitability curve in phase space (dV/dt as a function of V, [Fig. 2A](#pcbi-1000850-g002)). With no DC injected current (I\\u200a=\\u200a0, solid curve), the differential equation has two fixed points, which are solutions of F(V)\\u200a=\\u200a0: the lower one is stable and corresponds to the resting potential and the higher one is unstable and corresponds to the threshold for fast depolarizations (short current pulses, i.e., ![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e011)), which we denote ![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e012). Indeed, after depolarization, the membrane potential V either goes back to the resting potential if ![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e013) or keeps on increasing if ![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e014), leading to a spike. If the neuron is progressively depolarized with a slowly increasing current, then the excitability curve slowly shifts upwards, depolarizing the stable potential, until the curve is entirely above zero and the neuron spikes ([Fig. 2A](#pcbi-1000850-g002), dashed curve). At that critical point, the curve is tangential to the horizontal axis and the voltage ![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e015) corresponds to the minimum of that curve: ![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e016). Thus, the voltage threshold for slow inputs (i.e., DC currents, or slow current ramps) is the solution of F′(V)\\u200a=\\u200a0 and the voltage threshold for fast inputs (i.e., instantaneous charge inputs, or short current pulses) is the solution of F(V)\\u200a=\\u200a0 with F′(V)>0.\\n\\n![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e010)\\n![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e011)\\n![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e012)\\n![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e013)\\n![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e014)\\n![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e015)\\n![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e016)\\n\\nThe current-voltage function F(V) can be approximated by an exponential function near spike initiation (see [Materials and Methods](#s4)), leading to the exponential integrate-and-fire model [[48]](#pcbi.1000850-FourcaudTrocm1). In that model, we can calculate the relationship between the voltage threshold for slow inputs VT and the voltage threshold for fast inputs ![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e017) (see [Text S1](#pcbi.1000850.s001)):![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e018)where ![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e019) is the slope factor, characterizing the sharpness of spikes (see [Materials and Methods](#s4)). In single-compartment models, this is related to the slope of the Na activation curve. This formula provides a simple monotonous relationship between the two types of threshold, which is almost linear (the derivative of ![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e020) with respect to VT is (![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e021)), which is close to 1; see [Fig. 2B](#pcbi-1000850-g002)). In our analysis, we chose the definition for slow depolarizations because it simplifies our formulas, but one can map the results to the definition for fast depolarizations using the formula above.\\n\\n![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e017)\\n![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e018)\\n![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e019)\\n![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e020)\\n![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e021)\\n\\nEmpirical threshold measures used *in vivo* can be analyzed in the same way. For example, the voltage threshold measured by the first derivative method is the value ![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e022) such that dV/dt\\u200a=\\u200akth, i.e., the solution of ![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e023). The empirical threshold can be approximately related to VT with the following formula (see [Text S1](#pcbi.1000850.s001)):![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e024)where ![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e025) is the membrane time constant (R\\u200a=\\u200a1/gL is the membrane resistance). Although the relationship is more complex and shows a slight dependence on the input current I (thus increasing apparent threshold variability), it is still related with VT through a monotonous (in fact quasi-linear) relationship and the choice of criterion kth results mainly in a shift of the threshold, as shown in [Fig. 2D](#pcbi-1000850-g002).\\n\\n![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e022)\\n![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e023)\\n![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e024)\\n![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e025)\\n\\nIn the remaining of this paper, we chose the voltage threshold for slow depolarizations VT as the definition of the spike threshold (i.e., the voltage at current threshold).\\n\\n### The threshold equation\\n\\n#### Sodium channel activation.\\n\\nCells excitability is generally due to the presence of voltage-gated sodium channels [[49]](#pcbi.1000850-Hille1). More precisely, Na channel activation gates mediate a positive feedback mechanism, which produces the instability phenomenon necessary to initiate an action potential. Activation is very fast compared to all other relevant time constants (a fraction of ms), in particular the membrane time constant [[50]](#pcbi.1000850-Baranauskas1). We make the approximation that it is instantaneous, so that the proportion of open sodium channels at any time is ![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e026). The membrane equation is then:![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e027)where gNa (resp. gL) is the maximum Na conductance (resp. leak conductance) and ENa (resp. EL) is the Na reversal potential (resp. leak reversal potential). We neglect inactivation and other ionic channels for the moment (see below). The activation function ![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e028) is well approximated by a Boltzmann function [[51]](#pcbi.1000850-Angelino1) with half-activation voltage Va and activation slope factor ka. In the relevant part of that function, near spike initiation, it reduces to an exponential function and the membrane equation reads (see [Materials and Methods](#s4)):![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e029)where![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e030)is the threshold (defined for slow inputs). The activation slope factor ![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e031) corresponds to the steepness of the Na activation curve, and characterizes the sharpness of spikes in single-compartment models (in the limit ![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e032) mV, the model tends to an integrate-and-fire model; it can be different in multicompartment models, see [Discussion](#s3)). The slope factor shows little variation across sodium channel types (ka\\u200a=\\u200a4–8 mV for neuronal channels, Angelino and Brenner, 2007 [[51]](#pcbi.1000850-Angelino1)). Thus, the threshold is primarily determined by the half-activation voltage and the density of sodium channels in log scale, relative to the leak conductance (see [Fig. 3A–C](#pcbi-1000850-g003)).\\n\\n![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e026)\\n![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e027)\\n![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e028)\\n![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e029)\\n![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e030)\\n![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e031)\\n![](article/file?type=thumbnail&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.e032)\\n![thumbnail](article/figure/image?size=inline&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000850.g003)\\n\\nA, Excitability curve of the model for different values of the ratio gNa/gL (maximum Na conductance over leak conductance), discarding inactivation (h\\u200a=\\u200a1) and other ionic conductances.

It was originally used to describe the dynamics of the action potential in the squid giant axon but the description of the conductances in terms of activation and inactivation variables is now used ubiquitously to model neurons in a wide range of species and brain areas. It is a “conductance-based neuron,” meaning that it models the voltage- and time-dependent conductances of real ion channels (contrast this with the integrate-and-fire neuron model which does not model real ionic conductances). I. Mathematical description of the Hodgkin-Huxley neuron Today, we will build a Hodgkin-Huxley model neuron by numerically integrating the model equations for V, m, h, and n given below: e m m I dV c i dt A = − + where A is the area of the cell and the membrane currents im are given by 4 3 ( ) ( ) ( m L L K K Na Na i g V E g n V E g m h V E = − + − + − ) The activation variables m and n, as well as the inactivation variable h, are all described by equations of the form (note that rather than referring explicitly to which of these are “activation” versus “inactivation” variables, we sometimes just refer to them all less specifically as “gating” variables because they control the gateway to letting ions flow through the channels): ( ) ( ) , 1 ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) n n n n n n n dn V n V n dt V V V V n V V V τ τ α β α α β ∞ ∞ = − = + = + (and similarly for m and h), with .01( 55) ( ) , ( ) 0.125exp( 0.0125( 65)), 1 exp( .1( 55)) .1( 40) ( ) , ( ) 4exp( 0.0556( 65)), 1 exp( .1( 40)) 1 ( ) .07exp( .05( 65)), ( ) 1 exp( .1( 35)) n n m m h h V V V V V V V V V V V V α β α β α β + = = − − − + + = = − − − + = − + = + − + V V + + In the above equations, time is in ms and V in mV. In the model of the giant squid axon, the corresponding parameters are cm=10 nF/mm2, L g =0.003 mS/mm2, K g =0.36 mS/mm2, Na g =1.2 mS/mm2, EL= −54.387 mV, EK= −77 mV, and ENa=50 mV. 1 II. Today’s modeling goal The goal of this lab is to generate action potentials in the Hodgkin-Huxley neuron in response to a constant current injection Ie, and plot the cell’s voltage V and the values of the activation and inactivation variables m, h, and n during the action potential. We will then compute the firing rate of the model neuron. To do this, we will build a Hodgkin-Huxley model as described in section I above. For initial values we will take V = -65 mV, m = 0.0529, h = 0.5961, and n = 0.3177 (these equal the steady-state values at this voltage: m=m∞(-65), h= h∞(-65), n=n∞(-65)). We will use an external current of Ie/A = 200 nA/mm2 and we will integrate the equations using a time step dt=0.1 ms. III. Step 1: Response to a constant current injection As usual, let’s open a new m-file, name it something memorable like “HHStep1.m”, put a comment at the top describing what is being done in this assignment, and clear all variables that might be leftover from previous runs or lines typed into the command window: % Lab 3: Build a Hodgkin-Huxley model neuron; stimulate to produce AP’s; plot V and % activation and inactivation variables m, h, and n; and calculate firing rate clear all; %clear all variables close all; %close any open matlab windows Next let’s define the model parameters. We immediately have to be very careful(!!!) to make sure that the units that we use are all consistent, just as in your Flicker Fusion homework question you had to convert the frequency f of the cosine from Hz (=1/sec) to (1/ms). As given, the numbers in fact do not produce consistent units: Ie/A is given in nA/mm2; cmdV/dt is given in [nF/mm2]*[mV/ms] = nA/mm2 (so this is consistent so far…), but g V is given in units of [mS/mm2][mV] = μA/mm2. To get this term in nA/mm2, we should instead use g values given in μS/mm2 (exercise: check that this is correct). To do this, we need to multiply the given values by 1000 because there are 1000 μS per mS. We can do this in scientific notation by appending “e3” (which means ‘times 10^3’ in the computer version of scientific notation) to the end of the values given per mS. Doing this, and listing the other parameters for our simulation, gives: %DEFINE PARAMETERS dt = 0.1; %time step [ms] t_end = 70; %total time of run [ms] t_StimStart = 10; %time to start injecting current [ms] t_StimEnd = 60; %time to end injecting current [ms] c = 10; %capacitance per unit area [nF/mm^2] gmax_L = 0.003e3; %leak maximal conductance per unit area [uS/mm^2] E_L = -54.387; %leak conductance reversal potential [mV] gmax_K = 0.36e3; %hodgkin-huxley maximal K conductance per unit area [uS/mm^2] E_K = -77; %hodgkin-huxley K conductance reversal potential [mV] gmax_Na = 1.2e3; %hodgkin-huxley maximal Na conductance per unit area [uS/mm^2] E_Na = 50; %hodgkin-huxley Na conductance reversal potential [mV] 2 Sometimes it is useful to work backwards from the end of a program when writing computer code. Let’s next write the plotting code that will appear at the end of the program. This will help us to figure out what variables need to be set up in vectors that will contain an element for each time point. We want to plot vectors containing the values of V, m, h, and n as a function of time so let’s set up 4 subplots with appropriate labels: figure(1) subplot(4,1,1) plot(t_vect,V_vect) title(\\'Hodgkin Huxley variables vs. time\\'); ylabel(\\'Voltage in mV\\'); subplot(4,1,2) plot(t_vect,m_vect) ylabel(\\'g_{Na} activation variable m\\'); subplot(4,1,3) plot(t_vect,h_vect) ylabel(\\'g_{Na} inactivation variable h\\'); subplot(4,1,4) plot(t_vect,n_vect) xlabel(\\'Time in ms\\'); ylabel(\\'g_{K} activation variable n\\'); Now that we know what vectors we want to plot (i.e. t_vect, V_vect, m_vect, h_vect, n_vect), let’s go back to the line after the parameters were defined and set up vectors of the correct size filled with zeros as placeholders (remember: this makes the code run faster, see Lab 2 for details): %SET UP VECTORS TO BE PLOTTED t_vect = 0:dt:t_end; %will hold vector of times V_vect = zeros(1,length(t_vect)); %initialize the voltage vector m_vect = zeros(1,length(t_vect)); %initialize the HH Na activation variable vector h_vect = zeros(1,length(t_vect)); %initialize the HH Na inactivation variable vector n_vect = zeros(1,length(t_vect)); %initialize the the HH K activation variable vector Then, let’s define the initial (first time point corresponding to t=0) values of these vectors: %ASSIGN INITIAL VALUES OF VARIABLES i = 1; %index denoting which element of V is being assigned V_vect(i)= -65; %first element of V, i.e. value of V at t=0 [mV] m_vect(i) = 0.0529; %initially set m = m_inf(-65) h_vect(i) = 0.5961; %initially set h = h_inf(-65) n_vect(i) = 0.3177; %initially set n = n_inf(-65) We initialize the voltage to -65 mV and then initialize the m, h, and n vectors to the steady-state values m∞(-65), h∞(-65), and n∞(-65) that correspond to this voltage. You could have calculated these values in your code (or by hand on a calculator, or in MATLAB’s command window). They are provided above to make our code a little shorter and simpler looking. 3 Now let’s define the stimulus, the code of which we will borrow (with a few slight changes in variable names) from our last lab on the integrate-and-fire neuron, i.e. do a pulse of current from t_StimStart to t_StimEnd of magnitude I_0: %DEFINE THE STIMULUS %vector below will hold values of I_e/A over time; I_0 = 200; %magnitude of pulse of injected current [nA/mm^2] I_e_vect = zeros(1,t_StimStart/dt); %portion of I_e/A vector from t=0 to t=t_StimStart I_e_vect = [I_e_vect I_0*ones(1,1+((t_StimEnd-t_StimStart)/dt))]; %add portion from % t=t_StimStart to t=t_StimEnd I_e_vect = [I_e_vect zeros(1,(t_end-t_StimEnd)/dt)]; %add portion from % t=t_StimEnd to t=t_ Good! Now we’re ready to integrate the equations. First you should convince yourself that the voltage equation is in the form of the “1 equation of neuroscience”: V dV V V dt τ ∞ = − + where 4 3 4 3 4 3 ( ) V L K Na L L K K Na Na e L K Na c g g n g m h g E g n E g m hE I A V g g n g m h τ ∞ = + + + + + = + + (as a useful exercise, try deriving this now). Now notice that the time constants for V,m,n, and h, and the steady-state variables V∞, m∞, h∞, and n∞ are all interdependent and will each change values at every time step. This means that we had better include them within the for loop over time. Let’s layout the for loop systematically. First let’s set up the for loop: %INTEGRATE THE HH EQUATIONS for t=dt:dt:t_end %loop through values of t in steps of dt ms end Within this loop (please indent!), let’s first assign all of the activation and inactivation variables, which first requires defining the α’s and β’s: %assign all of the alphas & betas alpha_m = .1*(V_vect(i)+40)/(1 - exp(-.1*(V_vect(i)+40))); beta_m = 4*exp(-.0556*(V_vect(i)+65)); alpha_h = .07*exp(-.05*(V_vect(i)+65)); beta_h = 1/(1 + exp(-.1*(V_vect(i)+35))); alpha_n = .01*(V_vect(i)+55)/(1 - exp(-.1*(V_vect(i)+55))); beta_n = 0.125*exp(-0.0125*(V_vect(i)+65)); %from the alphas & betas above, assign the taus & x_inf\\'s for m,h,n tau_m = 1/(alpha_m + beta_m); m_inf = alpha_m/(alpha_m + beta_m); tau_h = 1/(alpha_h + beta_h); h_inf = alpha_h/(alpha_h + beta_h); 4 tau_n = 1/(alpha_n + beta_n); n_inf = alpha_n/(alpha_n + beta_n); Notice that these are defined in terms of V_vect(i) which the first time through the loop will be V_vect(1). While we are at it, let’s define the time constant τV and steady-state value V∞ for the voltage as well. Note that these depend on the values of the gating variables m_vect(i), h_vect(i), and n_vect(i) through the equation on the previous page. Also, looking at that equation, note that both τV and V∞ are long expressions that each have the same denominator. Therefore, to make our code more readable (and slightly more efficient), we first define a variable to hold the denominator: %assign tau_V and V_inf V_denominator = gmax_L + gmax_K*(n_vect(i)^4) + gmax_Na*(m_vect(i)^3)*h_vect(i); tau_V = c/V_denominator; V_inf =(gmax_L*E_L + gmax_K*(n_vect(i)^4)*E_K + ... %... let\\'s you continue on next line gmax_Na*(m_vect(i)^3)*h_vect(i)*E_Na + I_e_vect(i))/V_denominator; Notice that we have used a new MATLAB operation here: writing “…” lets you continue writing a single command on more than one line. This can be useful when you are writing very long lines if you don’t like having to scroll to your right to read them. Now we are ready to use our standard update rule to assign the next values of the gating variables m, h, and n and the voltage variable V: %assign next elements of m,h,and n vectors using update rule m_vect(i+1) = m_inf + (m_vect(i) - m_inf)*exp(-dt/tau_m); h_vect(i+1) = h_inf + (h_vect(i) - h_inf)*exp(-dt/tau_h); n_vect(i+1) = n_inf + (n_vect(i) - n_inf)*exp(-dt/tau_n); %assign next element of V vector using update rule V_vect(i+1) = V_inf + (V_vect(i) - V_inf)*exp(-dt/tau_V); Finally, let’s update i, so that the next time through the loop our code will be ready to assign the next elements of the m, h, n, and V vectors: %add 1 to index, corresponding to moving forward 1 time step i = i+1; Try running this code (see below for code summary if you get errors). You should see 5 beautiful action potentials in the top row and you should see underneath it, respectively, the m, n, and h variables. Notice which one(s) change quickly and which only more slowly. Does this fit with what you know about the openings, closings, and inactivation of Na+ and K+ channels that underlie the action potential? Next, to better be able to compare these variables, let’s add a second figure with them all plotted on the same graph but in different colors. To do this, type: figure(2) 5 plot(t_vect,V_vect) %plot in blue title(\\'Hodgkin Huxley variables vs. time\\'); ylabel(\\'V, m, h,or n\\'); xlabel(\\'Time in ms\\'); hold on plot(t_vect,m_vect,\\'k\\') %plot in black plot(t_vect,h_vect,\\'r\\') %plot in red plot(t_vect,n_vect,\\'g\\') %plot in green legend(\\'V\\', \\'m\\', \\'h\\',\\'n\\') You should see a beautiful trace of the voltage accompanied by a mess near a value of zero. What went wrong? (think about this before reading on…) The problem is that the voltage goes over a range of nearly 100 mV whereas the gating variables go only from zero to 1. Therefore to make the plots more equal, let’s multiply the gating variables by 100 within the plotting commands (this can be thought of as converting them from fractions of 1 to percentages where 100% = 1) by modifying the last five lines from above to read: plot(t_vect,100*m_vect,\\'k\\') %plot in black plot(t_vect,100*h_vect,\\'r\\') %plot in red plot(t_vect,100*n_vect,\\'g\\') %plot in green ylabel(\\'V, m*100, h*100,or n*100\\'); xlabel(\\'Time in ms\\'); legend(\\'V\\', \\'m*100\\', \\'h*100\\',\\'n*100\\') The figure you should now obtain looks like the following: To really get a good idea of the timing of the various gating variables openings in relation to the voltage, you can zoom in on a smaller time window by clicking on the magnifying glass with the + sign in it in the Figure 2 toolbar and dragging the cursor (which should now look like the 6 magnifying glass) so as to make a box around the region of interest (as shown below, note gray box between 8 and 10 milliseconds). Take a moment now to study the timing of the different gating variables—which one rises to its peak first? Does this make sense? If you would like to return to the normal view, just double-click with the cursor in the window. Finally, make a 3rd figure in which you plot the voltage V; total activations of Na+ and K+ channels, m3 and n4, respectively; total open probability of the Na+ channel m3h; and inactivation variable h. What do you notice about these more experimentally-relevant values compared to when you plotted only m and h? [Code for this is in the code summary below if you need to check your code.] To summarize this section, your code should now read: % Lab 3: Build a Hodgkin-Huxley model neuron; stimulate to produce AP’s; plot V and % activation and inactivation variables m, h, and n; and calculate firing rate clear all; %clear all variables close all; %close any open matlab windows %DEFINE PARAMETERS dt = 0.1; %time step [ms] t_end = 70; %total time of run [ms] t_StimStart = 10; %time to start injecting current [ms] t_StimEnd = 60; %time to end injecting current [ms] c = 10; %capacitance per unit area [nF/mm^2] gmax_L = 0.003e3; %leak maximal conductance per unit area [uS/mm^2] E_L = -54.387; %leak conductance reversal potential [mV] gmax_K = 0.36e3; %hodgkin-huxley maximal K conductance per unit area [uS/mm^2] E_K = -77; %hodgkin-huxley K conductance reversal potential [mV] gmax_Na = 1.2e3; %hodgkin-huxley maximal Na conductance per unit area [uS/mm^2] 7 E_Na = 50; %hodgkin-huxley Na conductance reversal potential [mV] %SET UP VECTORS TO BE PLOTTED t_vect = 0:dt:t_end; %will hold vector of times V_vect = zeros(1,length(t_vect)); %initialize the voltage vector m_vect = zeros(1,length(t_vect)); %initialize the HH Na activation variable vector h_vect = zeros(1,length(t_vect)); %initialize the HH Na inactivation variable vector n_vect = zeros(1,length(t_vect)); %initialize the the HH K activation variable vector %ASSIGN INITIAL VALUES OF VARIABLES i = 1; %index denoting which element of V is being assigned V_vect(i)= -65; %first element of V, i.e. value of V at t=0 [mV] m_vect(i) = 0.0529; %initially set m = m_inf(-65) h_vect(i) = 0.5961; %initially set h = h_inf(-65) n_vect(i) = 0.3177; %initially set n = n_inf(-65) %DEFINE THE STIMULUS %vector below will hold values of I_e/A over time; I_0 = 200; %magnitude of pulse of injected current [nA/mm^2] I_e_vect = zeros(1,t_StimStart/dt); %portion of I_e/A vector from t=0 to t=t_StimStart I_e_vect = [I_e_vect I_0*ones(1,1+((t_StimEnd-t_StimStart)/dt))]; %add portion from % t=t_StimStart to t=t_StimEnd I_e_vect = [I_e_vect zeros(1,(t_end-t_StimEnd)/dt)]; %add portion from % t=t_StimEnd to t=t_end for t=dt:dt:t_end %loop through values of t in steps of dt ms %assign all of the alphas & betas alpha_m = .1*(V_vect(i)+40)/(1 - exp(-.1*(V_vect(i)+40))); beta_m = 4*exp(-.0556*(V_vect(i)+65)); alpha_h = .07*exp(-.05*(V_vect(i)+65)); beta_h = 1/(1 + exp(-.1*(V_vect(i)+35))); alpha_n = .01*(V_vect(i)+55)/(1 - exp(-.1*(V_vect(i)+55))); beta_n = 0.125*exp(-0.0125*(V_vect(i)+65)); %from the alphas & betas above, assign the taus & x_inf\\'s for m,h,n tau_m = 1/(alpha_m + beta_m); m_inf = alpha_m/(alpha_m + beta_m); tau_h = 1/(alpha_h + beta_h); h_inf = alpha_h/(alpha_h + beta_h); tau_n = 1/(alpha_n + beta_n); n_inf = alpha_n/(alpha_n + beta_n); %assign tau_V and V_inf V_denominator = gmax_L + gmax_K*(n_vect(i)^4) + gmax_Na*(m_vect(i)^3)*h_vect(i); tau_V = c/V_denominator; V_inf =(gmax_L*E_L + gmax_K*(n_vect(i)^4)*E_K + ... %... let\\'s you continue on next line gmax_Na*(m_vect(i)^3)*h_vect(i)*E_Na + I_e_vect(i))/V_denominator; %assign next elements of m,h,and n vectors using update rule m_vect(i+1) = m_inf + (m_vect(i) - m_inf)*exp(-dt/tau_m); h_vect(i+1) = h_inf + (h_vect(i) - h_inf)*exp(-dt/tau_h); n_vect(i+1) = n_inf + (n_vect(i) - n_inf)*exp(-dt/tau_n); %assign next element of V vector using update rule V_vect(i+1) = V_inf + (V_vect(i) - V_inf)*exp(-dt/tau_V); %add 1 to index, corresponding to moving forward 1 time step i = i+1; end 8 figure(1) subplot(4,1,1) plot(t_vect,V_vect) title(\\'Hodgkin Huxley variables vs. time\\'); ylabel(\\'Voltage in mV\\'); subplot(4,1,2) plot(t_vect,m_vect) ylabel(\\'g_{Na} activation variable m\\'); subplot(4,1,3) plot(t_vect,h_vect) ylabel(\\'g_{Na} inactivation variable h\\'); subplot(4,1,4) plot(t_vect,n_vect) xlabel(\\'Time in ms\\'); ylabel(\\'g_{K} activation variable n\\'); figure(2) plot(t_vect,V_vect) %plot in blue title(\\'Hodgkin Huxley variables vs. time\\'); hold on plot(t_vect,100*m_vect,\\'k\\') %plot in black plot(t_vect,100*h_vect,\\'r\\') %plot in red plot(t_vect,100*n_vect,\\'g\\') %plot in green ylabel(\\'V, m*100, h*100,or n*100\\'); xlabel(\\'Time in ms\\'); legend(\\'V\\', \\'m*100\\', \\'h*100\\',\\'n*100\\') figure(3) plot(t_vect,V_vect) %plot in blue title(\\'Hodgkin Huxley variables vs. time\\'); hold on plot(t_vect,100*m_vect.^3,\\'k\\') %plot in black plot(t_vect,100*h_vect,\\'r\\') %plot in red plot(t_vect,100*n_vect.^4,\\'g\\') %plot in green plot(t_vect,100*m_vect.^3.*h_vect,\\'m:\\') %plot in dotted magenta ylabel(\\'V, m^3*100, h*100,or n^4*100\\'); xlabel(\\'Time in ms\\'); legend(\\'V\\', \\'m^3*100\\', \\'h*100\\',\\'n^4*100\\',\\'m^3h*100\\') IV. Step 2: Calculate the firing rate Save your previous work and then, before continuing on, re-save it as HHStep2.m. In this section we will compute the average firing rate of the Hodgkin-Huxley model neuron. First, let’s expand the amount of time we run the model for so that we can count more spikes. In the DEFINE PARAMETERS section change t_end, t_StimStart, and t_StimEnd to t_end = 700; %total time of run [ms] t_StimStart = 100; %time to start injecting current [ms] t_StimEnd = 600; %time to end injecting current [ms] so that we get 500 ms of stimulation centered in a 700 ms window. 9 Now, how do we define when a spike occurred? Well, a spike occurs every time the voltage “goes sufficiently high”. What voltage do we want to consider “high enough” to say that the cell spiked? Let’s define a variable V_count_spike corresponding to the value we deem “high enough to count the cell as having spiked” and set V_count_spike equal to -10 mV, i.e. every time the cell passes -10 mV we’ll say that it has spiked. Add to the parameter definitions: V_count_spike = -10; % voltage we deem high enough to count as a spike [mV] Now to be more precise, we really want to say that we count the cell as having spiked when the voltage first rises upward through V_count_spike = -10 mV. To do this, let’s add an if statement within our for loop (put it just after the assignment of V_vect(i+1)): %count this as a spike if just crossed up through V_count_spike if ((V_vect(i) < V_count_spike) && (V_vect(i+1) > V_count_spike)) NumSpikes = NumSpikes + 1 end The && means “AND” so these statements say that we count a spike as occurring when the current value of the V vector element is greater than V_count_spike but the previous element is less than V_count_spike. This identifies when the voltage first passes upward through the spike-counting-threshold V_count_spike. Now do you see something missing here? (You should…). We just added one to a new variable NumSpikes which represents the number of spikes that have occurred, but we never set this variable equal to zero at the beginning of our run. At the end of the section ASSIGN INITIAL VALUES OF VARIABLES, we should add: NumSpikes = 0; %initializes variable holding number of spikes produced in run Now finally, at the end of our calculation code (outside the ‘for t’ loop but before plotting) let’s calculate the average firing rate as: %CALCULATE AVERAGE FIRING RATE AveRate = 1000*NumSpikes/(t_StimEnd - t_StimStart) %gives average firing rate in [#/sec = Hz] Leave off the semicolon so that this value prints out to your command window. Try this for a few values of I_0. If you try I_0 = 62 nA/mm2 (try it!), you’ll find that there are a few spikes to start which then die out. (Note: For the remainder of this laboratory, I recommend looking at Figure 1 because Figures 2 and 3 are rather crowded. You could even comment out the figure 2 and 3 code by selecting all of it, then right-clicking, then selecting “Comment”. You can undo this, i.e. uncomment the code, by following the same procedure but selecting “Uncomment”). We really don’t want to count these into our calculation of the average (sustained) firing rate in response to a particular level of current injection, as they completely die out and for a very long interval of stimulation the number of these per unit time would approach zero (because the number of spikes would stay fixed but the interval would get very long). Therefore, we really should start counting our spikes a couple hundred ms after we start stimulating. Let’s therefore make a new variable t_CountSpikeStart and set it to 200 ms after we start stimulating. Add to our parameter definitions, right after the line assigning t_StimStart: 10 t_CountSpikeStart = t_StimStart + 200; %when to start counting spikes for ave. rate [ms] Finally, we now need to modify the if statement above for counting spikes. Since we only want to start counting spikes once the time t_CountSpikeStart is reached, we should really qualify it by saying “if the time is between t_CountSpikeStart and t_StimEnd.” We can do this by adding a second if statement surrounding the first (we could also have added more &&’s but this would make the code harder to read): %count this as a spike if just crossed up through V_count_spike if ((t > t_CountSpikeStart) && (t <= t_StimEnd)) %if in spike counting interval if ((V_vect(i) < V_count_spike) && (V_vect(i+1) > V_count_spike)) NumSpikes = NumSpikes + 1; end end Note the indenting above. The second if statement only gets read by MATLAB if the first one is true, so in effect all of the above conditions must be true for NumSpikes to be increased by 1. Finally, let’s revise our AveRate assignment to reflect the new spike-counting interval: AveRate = 1000*NumSpikes/(t_StimEnd - t_CountSpikeStart) %gives average firing rate in [#/sec = Hz] Now if we again run our code with I_0 = 62, it correctly tells us that the average sustained rate (i.e. not including the few transient spikes when the stimulus first turns on) is zero. Try this with a few more values of input current to make sure that your code is working. Congratulations!

Specific voltage-dependent ion channels, one for sodium and another one for potassium, control the flow of those ions through the cell membrane. The leak current takes care of other channel types which are not described explicitly.\\n\\n2.2.1 Definition of the model\\n=============================\\n\\n![Image 1](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/x25.png)\\n\\nFig.2.2: Schematic diagram for the Hodgkin-Huxley model.\\n\\nThe Hodgkin-Huxley model can be understood with the help of Fig. [2.2](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S2.html#Ch2.F2 \"Fig.\\xa02.2 ‣ 2.2.1 Definition of the model ‣ 2.2 Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Chapter\\xa02 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part\\xa0I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks\\nand Models of Cognition\"). The semipermeable cell membrane separates the interior of the cell from the extracellular liquid and acts as a capacitor. If an input current I(t)I(t) is injected into the cell, it may add further charge on the capacitor, or leak through the channels in the cell membrane. Each channel type is represented in Fig. [2.2](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S2.html#Ch2.F2 \"Fig.\\xa02.2 ‣ 2.2.1 Definition of the model ‣ 2.2 Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Chapter\\xa02 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part\\xa0I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks\\nand Models of Cognition\") by a resistor. The unspecific channel has a leak resistance R R, the sodium channel a resistance R Na R Na and the potassium channel a resistance R K R K. The diagonal arrow across the diagram of the resistor indicates that the value of the resistance is not fixed, but changes depending on whether the ion channel is open or closed. Because of active ion transport through the cell membrane, the ion concentration inside the cell is different from that in the extracellular liquid. The Nernst potential generated by the difference in ion concentration is represented by a battery in Fig. [2.2](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S2.html#Ch2.F2 \"Fig.\\xa02.2 ‣ 2.2.1 Definition of the model ‣ 2.2 Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Chapter\\xa02 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part\\xa0I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks\\nand Models of Cognition\"). Since the Nernst potential is different for each ion type, there are separate batteries for sodium, potassium, and the unspecific third channel, with battery voltages E Na,E K E Na,E K and E L E L, respectively.\\n\\nLet us now translate the above schema of an electrical circuit into mathematical equations. The conservation of electric charge on a piece of membrane implies that the applied current I(t)I(t) may be split in a capacitive current I C I C which charges the capacitor C C and further components I k I k which pass through the ion channels. Thus\\n\\nI(t)=I C(t)+∑k I k(t)\\n\\nI(t)=I C(t)+∑k I k(t)(2.3)\\n\\nwhere the sum runs over all ion channels. In the standard Hodgkin-Huxley model there are only three types of channel: a sodium channel with index Na, a potassium channel with index K and an unspecific leakage channel with resistance R R; cf.Fig.[2.2](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S2.html#Ch2.F2 \"Fig.\\xa02.2 ‣ 2.2.1 Definition of the model ‣ 2.2 Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Chapter\\xa02 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part\\xa0I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks\\nand Models of Cognition\"). From the definition of a capacity C=q/u C=q/u where q q is a charge and u u the voltage across the capacitor, we find the charging current I C=C d u/d t I C=C d u/d t.

A. The equilibrium functions for the three variables m,n,h m,n,h in the Hodgkin-Huxley model. B. The voltage dependent time constant. The resting potential is at u=-65 m V u=−65 m V (arrow) and parameters are those given in Table [2.1](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S2.html#Ch2.T1 \"Table\\xa02.1 ‣ 2.2.1 Definition of the model ‣ 2.2 Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Chapter\\xa02 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part\\xa0I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks\\nand Models of Cognition\"). \\n\\nAs mentioned above, the Hodgkin-Huxley model describes three types of channel. All channels may be characterized by their resistance or, equivalently, by their conductance. The leakage channel is described by a voltage-independent conductance g L=1/R g L=1/R. Since u u is the total voltage across the cell membrane and E L E L the voltage of the battery, the voltage at the leak resistor in Fig. [2.2](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S2.html#Ch2.F2 \"Fig.\\xa02.2 ‣ 2.2.1 Definition of the model ‣ 2.2 Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Chapter\\xa02 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part\\xa0I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks\\nand Models of Cognition\") is u-E L u−E L. Using Ohm’s law, we get a leak current I L=g L(u-E L)I L=g L(u−E L).\\n\\nThe mathematics of the other ion channels is analogous except that their conductance is voltage and time dependent. If all channels are open, they transmit currents with a maximum conductance g Na g Na or g K g K, respectively. Normally, however, some of the channels are blocked. The breakthrough of Hodgkin and Huxley was that they succeeded to measure how the effective resistance of a channel changes as a function of time and voltage. Moreover, they proposed a mathematical description of their observations. Specifically, they introduced additional ’gating’ variables m,n m,n and h h to model the probability that a channel is open at a given moment in time. The combined action of m m and h h controls the Na++ channels while the K++ gates are controlled by n n. For example, the effective conductance of sodium channels is modeled as 1/R Na=g Na m 3 h 1/R Na=g Na m 3 h, where m m describes the activation (opening) of the channel and h h its inactivation (blocking). The conductance of potassium is 1/R K=g K n 4 1/R K=g K n 4, where n n describes the activation of the channel.\\n\\nIn summary, Hodgkin and Huxley formulated the three ion currents on the right-hand-side of Eq.

Adapted from ([222](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/bib.html#bib20 \"A quantitative description of membrane current and its application to conduction and excitation in nerve.\")).\\n\\nExample: Activation and De-inactivation\\n\\nThe variable m m is called an activation variable. To understand this terminology, we note from Fig. [2.3](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S2.html#Ch2.F3 \"Fig.\\xa02.3 ‣ 2.2.1 Definition of the model ‣ 2.2 Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Chapter\\xa02 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part\\xa0I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks\\nand Models of Cognition\") that the value of m 0(u)m 0(u) at the neuronal resting potential of u u=-65mV is close to zero. Therefore, at rest, the sodium current I Na=g Na m 3 h(u-E Na)I Na=g Na m 3 h(u−E Na) through the channel vanishes. In other words, the sodium channel is closed.\\n\\nWhen the membrane potential increases significantly above the resting potential, the gating variable m m increases to its new value m 0(u)m 0(u). As long as h h does not change, the sodium current increases and the gate opens. Therefore the variable m m ’activates’ the channel. If, after a return of the voltage to rest, m m decays back to zero, it is said to be ‘de-activating’.\\n\\nThe terminology of the ‘inactivation’ variable h h is analogous. At rest, h h has a large positive value. If the voltage increases to a value above -40mV, h h approaches a new value h 0(u)h 0(u) which is close to rest. Therefore the channel ‘inactivates’ (blocks) with a time constant that is given by τ h(u)τ h(u). If the voltage returns to zero, h h increases so that the channel undergoes ‘de-inactivation’. This sounds like a tricky vocabulary, but it turns out to be useful to distinguish between a deactivated channel (m m close to zero and h h close to one) and an inactivated channel (h h close to zero).\\n\\n2.2.2 Stochastic Channel Opening\\n================================\\n\\nThe number of ion channels in a patch of membrane is finite and individual ion channels open and close stochastically. Thus, when an experimentalist records the current flowing through a small patch of membrane, he does not find a smooth and reliable evolution of the measured variable over time but rather a highly fluctuating current, which looks different at each repetition of the experiment (Fig. [2.5](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S2.html#Ch2.F5 \"Fig.\\xa02.5 ‣ 2.2.2 Stochastic Channel Opening ‣ 2.2 Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Chapter\\xa02 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part\\xa0I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks\\nand Models of Cognition\")).\\n\\nThe Hodgkin-Huxley equations which describe the opening and closing of ion channels with deterministic equations for the variables m m, h h, and n n, correspond to the current density through a hypothetical, extremely large patch of membrane containing an infinite number of channels or, alternatively, to the current through a small patch of membrane but averaged over many repetitions of the same experiment (Fig. [2.5](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S2.html#Ch2.F5 \"Fig.\\xa02.5 ‣ 2.2.2 Stochastic Channel Opening ‣ 2.2 Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Chapter\\xa02 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part\\xa0I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks\\nand Models of Cognition\")).

We may interpret this process as a molecular switch between two states with voltage-dependent transition rates. For example, the activation variable n can be interpreted as the probability of finding a single potassium channel open. Therefore in a patch with K channels, approximately k≈(1-n)K channels are expected to be closed. We may interpret α n(u)Δ t as the probability that in a short time interval Δ t one of the momentarily closed channels switches to the open state.\\n\\n2.2.3 Dynamics\\n==============\\n\\n| A |  |\\n| --- |\\n|  | ![Image 6](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/x30.png) |\\n| B |  |\\n|  | ![Image 7](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/x31.png) |\\n| C |  |\\n|  | ![Image 8](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/x32.png) |\\n\\nFig.2.6: A. Action potential. The Hodgkin-Huxley model is stimulated by a short, but strong, current pulse between t=1 and t=2 ms. The time course of the membrane potential u(t) for t>2 ms shows the action potential (positive peak) followed by a relative refractory period where the potential is below the resting potential u rest (dashed line). The right panel shows an expanded view of the action potential between t=2 and t=5 ms. B. The dynamics of gating variables m, h, n illustrate how the action potential is mediated by sodium and potassium channels. C. The sodium current I Na which depends on the variables m and h has a sharp peak during the upswing of an action potential. The potassium current I K is controlled by the variable n and starts with a delay compared to I Na. \\n\\nIn this subsection we study the dynamics of the Hodgkin-Huxley model for different types of input. Pulse input, constant input, step current input, and time-dependent input are considered in turn. These input scenarios have been chosen so as to provide an intuitive understanding of the dynamics of the Hodgkin-Huxley model.\\n\\nThe most important property of the Hodgkin-Huxley model is its ability to generate action potentials. In Fig.[2.6](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S2.html#Ch2.F6 \"Fig.\\xa02.6 ‣ 2.2.3 Dynamics ‣ 2.2 Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Chapter\\xa02 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part\\xa0I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks\\nand Models of Cognition\")A an action potential has been initiated by a short current pulse of 1 ms duration applied at t=1 ms. The spike has an amplitude of nearly 100mV and a width at half maximum of about 2.5ms. After the spike, the membrane potential falls below the resting potential and returns only slowly back to its resting value of -65mV.\\n\\nIon channel dynamics during spike generation\\n============================================\\n\\nIn order to understand the biophysics underlying the generation of an action potential we return to Fig.[2.3](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S2.html#Ch2.F3 \"Fig.\\xa02.3 ‣ 2.2.1 Definition of the model ‣ 2.2 Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Chapter\\xa02 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part\\xa0I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks\\nand Models of Cognition\")A. We find that m 0 and n 0 increase with u whereas h 0 decreases. Thus, if some external input causes the membrane voltage to rise, the conductance of sodium channels increases due to increasing m. As a result, positive sodium ions flow into the cell and raise the membrane potential even further. If this positive feedback is large enough, an action potential is initiated. The explosive increase comes to a natural halt when the membrane potential approaches the reversal potential E Na of the sodium current.\\n\\nAt high values of u the sodium conductance is slowly shut off due to the factor h. As indicated in Fig.[2.3](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S2.html#Ch2.F3 \"Fig.\\xa02.3 ‣ 2.2.1 Definition of the model ‣ 2.2 Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Chapter\\xa02 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part\\xa0I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks\\nand Models of Cognition\")B, the ‘time constant’ τ h is always larger than τ m. Thus the variable h which inactivates the channels reacts more slowly to the voltage increase than the variable m which opens the channel. On a similar slow time scale, the potassium (K+) current sets in Fig.[2.6](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S2.html#Ch2.F6 \"Fig.\\xa02.6 ‣ 2.2.3 Dynamics ‣ 2.2 Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Chapter\\xa02 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part\\xa0I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks\\nand Models of Cognition\")C. Since it is a current in outward direction, it lowers the potential. The overall effect of the sodium and potassium currents is a short action potential followed by a negative overshoot; cf. Fig.[2.6](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S2.html#Ch2.F6 \"Fig.\\xa02.6 ‣ 2.2.3 Dynamics ‣ 2.2 Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Chapter\\xa02 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part\\xa0I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks\\nand Models of Cognition\")A. The negative overshoot, called hyperpolarizing spike-after potential, is due to the slow de-inactivation of the sodium channel, caused by the h-variable.\\n\\nA B\\n![Image 9](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/x33.png)![Image 10](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/x34.png)\\nC D\\n![Image 11](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/x35.png)![Image 12](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/x36.png)\\n\\nFig.2.7: A.

The membrane potential, x₁, represents the electrical voltage across the neuron's cell membrane, typically measured in millivolts (mV) [3, 5, 7]. A resting potential is often around -70 mV [3, 5]. Its dynamic fluctuations are fundamental to neuronal signaling and action potential generation [1, 3, 4].\\n\\nThe fast activation variable, x₂, models rapid ion channel dynamics, such as voltage-gated sodium channel activation, which drives quick depolarization during an action potential [1, 2, 3]. These processes occur on a fast millisecond timescale [1, 2].\\n\\nThe slow adaptation variable, x₃, captures slower biophysical processes like the activation of potassium or calcium-gated potassium currents [1, 2]. These currents mediate spike-frequency adaptation and regulate firing patterns over slower timescales [1, 2, 3].\\n\\nThe target variable, y = dx₁/dt, represents the rate of change of the membrane potential [1, 3, 4, 6, 7]. This derivative quantifies how quickly the membrane voltage changes, crucial for characterizing the rapid upstroke and repolarization phases of neuronal spikes [1, 3].

This means that when there is one equilibrium point, it must be a clockwise spiral point or a node. When there are three equilibrium points, they must be two clockwise spiral points and one saddle point.\\n\\n*   If the linear nullcline pierces the cubic nullcline from downwards then it is a clockwise spiral point or a node.\\n*   If the linear nullcline pierces the cubic nullcline from upwards in the middle branch, then it is a saddle point.\\n\\nThe type and stability of the index +1 can be numerically computed by computing the trace and determinant of its Jacobian: (t r,det)=(1−b/τ−v 2,(v 2−1)b/τ+1/τ){\\\\displaystyle (tr,\\\\det )=(1-b/\\\\tau -v^{2},(v^{2}-1)b/\\\\tau +1/\\\\tau )}![Image 19: {\\\\displaystyle (tr,\\\\det )=(1-b/\\\\tau -v^{2},(v^{2}-1)b/\\\\tau +1/\\\\tau )}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b2ca9c137d075fc6bb11ddc0c2478a4e9c2b1cda)The point is stable iff the trace is negative.

We make no attempt here to give other than a basic introduction to it and discuss one of the key mathematical models which has been studied extensively. Rinzel (1981) gives a short review of models in neurobiology; see also Keener and Sneyd (1998).\\nElectric signalling or ﬁring by individual nerve cells or neurons is particularly com-mon. The seminal and now classical work by Hodgkin and Huxley (1952) on this aspect of nerve membranes was on the nerve axon of the giant squid. (They were awarded a Nobel prize for their work.) Basically the axon is a long cylindrical tube which extends from each neuron and electrical signals propagate along its outer membrane, about 50 to 70 ˚ Angstr¨ oms thick. The electrical pulses arise because the membrane is preferentially permeable to various chemical ions with the permeabilities affected by the currents and potentials present. The key elements in the system are potassium (K+) ions and sodium (Na+) ions. In the rest state there is a transmembrane potential difference of about −70 millivolts (mV) due to the higher concentration of K+ ions within the axon as compared with the surrounding medium. The deviation in the potential across the membrane, mea-sured from the rest state, is a primary observable in experiments. The membrane per-meability properties change when subjected to a stimulating electrical current I: they also depend on the potential. Such a current can be generated, for example, by a local depolarisation relative to the rest state.\\nIn this section we are concerned with the space-clamped dynamics of the system; that is, we consider the spatially homogeneous dynamics of the membrane. With a real axon the space-clamped state can be obtained experimentally by having a wire down the middle of the axon maintained at a ﬁxed potential difference to the outside. Later, in Chapter 1, Volume II, we shall discuss the important spatial propagation of action potential impulses along the nerve axon; we shall refer back to the model we discuss here. We derive here the Hodgkin–Huxley (1952) model and the reduced analytically tractable FitzHugh–Nagumo mathematical model (FitzHugh 1961, Nagumo et al. 1962) which captures the key phenomena. The analysis of the various mathematical models has indicated phenomena which have motivated considerable experimental work. The theory of neuron ﬁring and propagation of nerve action potentials is one of the major successes of real mathematical biology.\\nBasic Mathematical Model Let us take the positive direction for the membrane current, denoted by I, to be out-wards from the axon. The current I (t) is made up of the current due to the individual ions which pass through the membrane and the contribution from the time variation in the transmembrane potential, that is, the membrane capacitance contribution. Thus we have I (t) = C dv dt + Ii, (7.35) 240 7. Biological Oscillators and Switches where C is the capacitance and Ii is the current contribution from the ion movement across the membrane. Based on experimental observation Hodgkin and Huxley (1952) took Ii = INa + IK + IL, = gNam3h(V −VNa) + gK n4(V −VK ) + gL(V −VL), (7.36) where V is the potential and INa, IK and IL are respectively the sodium, potassium and ‘leakage’ currents; IL is the contribution from all the other ions which contribute to the current. The g’s are constant conductances with, for example, gNam3h the sodium conductance, and VNa, VK and VL are constant equilibrium potentials. The m, n and h are variables, bounded by 0 and 1, which are determined by the differential equations dm dt = αm(V )(1 −m) −βm(V )m, dn dt = αn(V)(1 −n) −βn(V )n, dh dt = αh(V )(1 −h) −βh(V)h, (7.37) where the α and β are given functions of V (again empirically determined by ﬁtting the results to the data); see, for example, Keener and Sneyd (1998). αn and αm are qualitatively like (1+tanh V )/2 while αh(V ) is qualitatively like (1−tanh V )/2, which is a ‘turn-off’ switch if V is moderately large. Hodgkin and Huxley (1952) ﬁtted the data with exponential forms.\\nIf an applied current Ia(t) is imposed the governing equation using (7.35) becomes C dV dt = −gNam3h(V −VNa) −gK n4(V −VK ) −gL(V −VL) + Ia.\\n(7.38) The system (7.38) with (7.37) constitute the 4-variable model which was solved numer-ically by Hodgkin and Huxley (1952).\\nIf Ia = 0, the rest state of the model (7.37) and (7.38) is linearly stable but is excitable in the sense discussed in Chapter 6. That is, if the perturbation from the steady state is sufﬁciently large there is a large excursion of the variables in their phase space before returning to the steady state. If Ia ̸= 0 there is a range of values where regular repetitive ﬁring occurs; that is, the mechanism displays limit cycle characteristics. Both types of phenomena have been observed experimentally. Because of the complexity of the equation system various simpler mathematical models, which capture the key features of the full system, have been proposed, the best known and particularly useful one of which is the FitzHugh–Nagumo model (FitzHugh 1961, Nagumo et al. 1962), which we now derive.\\nThe timescales for m, n and h in (7.37) are not all of the same order. The timescale for m is much faster than the others, so it is reasonable to assume it is sufﬁciently fast that it relaxes immediately to its value determined by setting dm/dt = 0 in (7.37). If we also set h = h0, a constant, the system still retains many of the features experi-7.5 FitzHugh–Nagumo Model 241 Figure 7.11. Phase plane for the model system (7.39) with Ia = 0. As the parameters vary there can be (a) one stable, but excitable state or, (b) three possible steady states, one unstable, namely, S1, and two stable, but excitable, namely, (0, 0) and S2.\\nmentally observed. The resulting 2-variable model in V and n can then be qualitatively approximated by the dimensionless system dv dt = f (v) −w + Ia, dw dt = bv −γ w, f (v) = v(a −v)(v −1), (7.39) where 0 < a < 1 and b and γ are positive constants. Here v is like the membrane potential V , and w plays the role of all three variables m, n and h in (7.37).\\nWith Ia = 0, or just a constant, the system (7.39) is simply a 2-variable phase plane system, the null clines for which are illustrated in Figure 7.11. Note how the Figure 7.12. (a) The phase portrait for (7.39) with Ia = 0, a = 0.25, b = γ = 2 × 10−3 which exhibits the threshold behaviour. With a perturbation from the steady state v = w = 0 to a point, P say, where w = 0, v < a, the trajectory simply returns to the origin with v and w remaining small. A perturbation to A initiates a large excursion along ABCD and then back to (0, 0), effectively along the null cline since b and γ are small.\\n(b) The time variation of v and w corresponding to the excitable trajectory ABC D0 in (a). (Redrawn from Rinzel 1981) 242 7. Biological Oscillators and Switches phase portrait varies with different values of the parameters a, b and γ . There can, for example, be 1 or 3 steady states as shown in Figures 7.11(a) and (b) respectively. The situation corresponds to that illustrated in Figure 7.5, except that here it is possible for v to be negative—it is an electric potential. The excitability characteristic, a key feature in the Hodgkin–Huxley system, is now quite evident. That is, a perturbation, for example, from 0 to a point on the v-axis with v > a, undergoes a large phase trajectory excursion before returning to 0. Figure 7.12 shows a speciﬁc example.\\nPeriodic Neuron Firing With Ia = 0 the possible phase portraits, as illustrated in Figure 7.11, show there can be no periodic solutions (see Section 7.3). Suppose now that there is an applied current Ia. The corresponding null clines for (7.39) are illustrated in Figures 7.13(a) to (c) for several Ia > 0. The effect on the null clines is simply to move the v null cline, with Ia = 0, up the w-axis. With parameter values such that the null clines are as in Figure 7.13(a) we can see that by varying only Ia there is a window of applied currents (I1, I2) where the steady state can be unstable and limit cycle oscillations possible, that is, a null cline situation like that in Figure 7.13(b). The algebra to determine the various parameter ranges for a, b, γ and Ia for each of these various possibilities to hold is straightforward. It is just an exercise in elementary analytical geometry, and is left as an exercise (Exercise 7). With the situation exhibited in Figure 7.13(d) limit cycle solutions are not possible. On the other hand this form can exhibit switch properties.\\nThe FitzHugh–Nagumo model (7.39) is a model of the Hodgkin–Huxley model.\\nSo, a further simpliﬁcation of the mechanism (7.39) is not unreasonable if it simpliﬁes the analysis or makes the various solution possibilities simpler to see. Of course such a simpliﬁcation must retain the major elements of the original, so care must be exercised.\\nFigure 7.13. Null clines for the FitzHugh–Nagumo model (7.39) with different applied currents Ia. Cases (a), where Ia < I1, and (c), where Ia > I2, have linearly stable, but excitable, steady states, while in (b), where I1 < Ia < I2, the steady state can be unstable and limit cycle periodic solutions are possible. With the conﬁguration (d), the steady states S1, S3 are stable with S2 unstable. Here a perturbation from either S1 or S3 can effect a switch to the other.\\n7.5 FitzHugh–Nagumo Model 243 Figure 7.14. (a) Phase plane null clines for a piecewise linear approximation to the v null cline in the FitzHugh–Nagumo model (7.30) with Ia = 0, where (v1, w1) and (v2, w2) are given by (7.40). (b) The geometric conditions for possible periodic solutions, which require Ia > 0, are shown in terms of the angle θ = tan−1[(w2 −w1)/(v2 −v1)]. (c) Geometric conditions for multiple roots and threshold switch possibilities from one steady state S1 to S3 and vice versa.\\nFrom Figure 7.11 we can reasonably approximate the v null cline by a piecewise linear approximation as in Figure 7.14, which in Figure 7.14(a) has zeros at v = 0, a, 1. The positions of the minimum and maximum, (v1, w1) and (v2, w2) are obtained from (7.39) as v2, v1 = 1 3 \\x02 a + 1 ± \\x10 (a + 1)2 −3a \\x111/2\\x03 , wi = −vi(a −vi)(1 −vi) + Ia, i = 1, 2.\\n(7.40) The line from (v1, w1) to (v2, w2) passes through v = a if a = 1/2. The acute angle θ the null cline makes with the v-axis in Figure 7.14 is given by θ = tan−1 \\x02w2 −w1 v2 −v1 \\x03 .\\n(7.41) We can now write down very simply a necessary condition for limit cycle oscil-lations for the piecewise model, that is, conditions for the null clines to be as in Fig-ure 7.14(b). The gradient of the v null cline at the steady state must be less than the gradient, b/γ , of the w null cline; that is, tan θ = w2 −w1 v2 −v1 < b γ .\\n(7.42) Sufﬁcient conditions for a limit cycle solution to exist are obtained by applying the re-sults of Section 7.3 and demonstrating that a conﬁned set exists. Analytical expressions for the limits on the applied current Ia for limit cycles can also be found (Exercise 7).\\nA major property of this model for the space-clamped axon membrane is that it can generate regular beating of a limit cycle nature when the applied current Ia is in an appropriate range I1 < Ia < I2. The bifurcation to a limit cycle solution when Ia increases past I1 is essentially a Hopf bifurcation and so the period of the limit cycle is given by an application of the Hopf bifurcation theorem. This model with periodic 244 7. Biological Oscillators and Switches beating solutions will be referred to again in Chapter 9 when we consider the effect of perturbations on the oscillations. All of the solution behaviour found with the model (7.39) have also been found in the full Hodgkin–Huxley model, numerically of course.\\nThe various solution properties have also been demonstrated experimentally.\\nSome neuron cells ﬁre with periodic bursts of oscillatory activity like that illustrated in Figures 7.7(b) and (d). We would expect such behaviour if we considered coupled neuronal cells which independently undergo continuous ﬁring. By modifying the above model to incorporate other ions, such as a calcium (Ca++) current, periodic bursting is obtained; see Plant (1978, 1981). There are now several neural phenomena where periodic bursts of ﬁring are observed experimentally. With the knowledge we now have of the qualitative nature of the terms and solution behaviour in the above models and some of their possible modiﬁcations, we can now build these into other models to reﬂect various observations which indicate similar phenomena. The ﬁeld of neural signalling, both temporal and spatial, is a fascinating and important one which will be an area of active research for many years.\\n7.6 Modelling the Control of Testosterone Secretion and Chemical Castration The hormone testosterone, although present in very small quantities in the blood, is an extremely important hormone; any regular imbalance can cause dramatic changes.\\nIn man, the blood levels of testosterone can ﬂuctuate periodically with periods of the order of two to three hours. In this section we discuss the physiology of testosterone production and construct and analyse a model, rather different from those we have so far discussed in this chapter, to try and explain the periodic levels of testosterone observed.\\nAlthough the phenomenon is interesting in its own right, another reason for discussing it is to demonstrate the procedure used to analyse this type of model. Perhaps most important, however, is to try and understand the mechanism of production with a view to aiding current research in controlling testosterone production in its use in (chemical) male contraception and prostate cancer control.\\nBefore describing the important physiological elements in the process of testos-terone production, there are some interesting effects and ideas associated with this im-portant hormone. Men have a testosterone level of between 10 to 35 nanomoles per litre of blood, with women having between 0.7 to 2.7 nanomoles per litre. Reduced levels of testosterone, or rather the level of a sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) directly re-lated to free testosterone, are often accompanied by personality changes—the individual tends to become less forceful and commanding. On the other hand increased levels of testosterone induce the converse. Although the actual differences in testosterone levels are minute, the effects can be major.\\nIn men the high level of testosterone primarily comes from the testes, which pro-duces about 90%, with the rest from other parts of the endocrine system, which is why women also produce it. The drug Goserelin, for example, which was introduced to treat cancer of the prostate, can achieve chemical castration within a few weeks after the start of treatment. The patient’s testosterone level is reduced to what would be achieved by removal of the testes. The body does not seem to adjust to the drug and so effective 7.6 Testosterone Secretion and Chemical Castration 245 castration continues only as long as the treatment is maintained. How the drug works in blocking the production of testosterone is pointed out below when we discuss the physiological production process. Enthusiasm for sex, or sex drive, depends on many factors and not only the level of testosterone, which certainly plays a very signiﬁcant role. If we consider the problem of an excessive sex drive, it is not uncommon for men sentenced for rape to ask to be treated with drugs to induce castration. There are now several drugs which effect castration: the already mentioned Goserelin, such as Lupron and Depo-provera which is more long lasting. The use of drugs to suppress the production of testosterone has been used in Europe for more than 10 years. In fact it is often a condition of release for convicted sex offenders. In Europe Depo-provera has reduced the recidivism rate of child molesters to 2% whereas in the U.S., where drugs are not generally used it is of the order of 50%. The role of testosterone-reducing drugs, or generally chemical castration, is a controversial area of treatment for sex of-fenders.\\nThe full physiological process is not yet fully understood although there is general agreement on certain key elements. The following shows how a ﬁrst model had to be modiﬁed to incorporate key physiological facts and points the way to more recent and complex models. We ﬁrst derive a model for testosterone (T) production in the male suggested by Smith (1980); it is based on accepted basic experimental facts. We then discuss a modiﬁcation which results in a delay model which incorporates more realistic physiology associated with the spatial separation of the various control regions. A more complicated delay model which is consistent with a wider range of experiments was proposed by Cartwright and Husain (1986): it incorporates more of the physiological process. We discuss it very brieﬂy below.\\nLet us now consider the basic physiology. The secretion of testosterone from the gonads is stimulated by a pituitary hormone called the luteinising hormone (LH). The secretion of LH from the pituitary gland is stimulated by the luteinising hormone releas-ing hormone (LHRH). This LHRH is normally secreted by the hypothalmus (part of the third ventricle in the brain) and carried to the pituitary gland by the blood. Testosterone is believed to have a feedback effect on the secretion of LH and LHRH. Based on these, Smith (1980) proposed a simple negative feedback compartment model, such as we dis-cussed in Section 7.2, involving the three hormones T, LH and LHRH and represented schematically in Figure 7.15.\\nDenote the concentrations of the LHRH, LH and T respectively by R(t), L(t) and T(t). At the simplest modelling level we consider each of the hormones to be cleared from the bloodstream according to ﬁrst-order kinetics with LH and T produced by their precursors according to ﬁrst-order kinetics. There is a nonlinear negative feedback by T(t) on R(t). The governing system reﬂecting this scheme is essentially the model feedback system (7.3), which here is written as d R dt = f (T) −b1R, dL dt = g1R −b2L, dT dt = g2L −b3T, (7.43)\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n--- SOURCE 6: PDF ---\\nURL: https://people.brandeis.edu/~pmiller/COMP_NEURO/lifb.pdf\\n\\nSUMMARY:\\nCurrent ﬂow per unit area out of the neuron through \"leak\" channels in the membrane is given by Im= GL(Vm− VL).

The capacitor represents the fact that cellular membranes are good electrical insulators.\\nThe battery represents the sodium-potassium pump that acts to hold the electrical potential of the inside of the cell below that of the outside. This voltage difference is called the resting potential of the neuron. The resistor represents the leakage of current through the membrane.\\nTo understand the behavior of this circuit, we ﬁrst need to review the behavior of the indi-vidual electrical elements. We’ll use a water balloon as an analogy to help develop our intuition.\\nFigure 1B shows a leaky water balloon connected to a water pump. When the pump is off, the balloon is empty. When the pump is ﬁrst turned on, the balloon starts to ﬁll with water. The bal-loon expands rapidly at ﬁrst because the force from the incoming water far overpowers the elastic force of the unexpanded balloon. As the balloon is stretched more and more, the elastic force gets greater and greater, so the balloon’s size increses ever more slowly, until it reaches equilibrium.\\nAt this point, the current ﬂowing into the balloon from the pump is equal to the current spurting out through the holes, and the water pressure inside the balloon is equal to the pressure exerted by the pump. Increasing the number (or size) of the holes would cause more water current to spurt out. Also, if there were more (or bigger) holes, then the balloon would not inﬂate quite as much.\\nThe behavior of the water balloon is expressed in terms of: (1) water volume, (2) water current, (3) water pressure inside the balloon, (4) the size/number of holes, and (5) the elasticity of the balloon.\\nIn the electrical RC circuit, the analogous quantities are: (1) electrical charge, (2) electrical current, (3) electrical potential, (4) electrical conductance, and (5) capacitance. Electrical charge (analogous to water volume), is measured in coulombs. Electrical current is the rate of ﬂow of charge (analogous to the rate of ﬂow of the water in and out of the balloon), and is measured in amperes or amps (1 amp = 1 coul/sec). Electrical resistance (analogous to the size/number of holes in the balloon) is measured in ohms. Electrical conductance is the reciprocal of resistance, and is measured in siemens (siemens = 1/ohms). Electrical potential (analogous to the water pressure) is measured in volts. One volt will move 1 amp of current through a 1 siemen conductor.\\nWhen we say that a neuron is “at rest”, it is actually in a state of dynamic equilibrium. There is always some current leaking out of the cell. But when at rest, that leak current is exactly balanced 1 Vm E g C water pump water balloon Vm E g C Iinject A B C Figure 1: A: RC circuit model of a passive neural membrane.

Likewise, once the water balloon is fully inﬂated, the current provided by the water pump equals the current spurting out through the holes and the net current in/out of the balloon is zero.\\nWe can think about the net current in/out of the balloon/cell in two different ways; one is analogous to the current through the battery/resistor branch of the electrical circuit and the other is analogous to the current through the capacitor of the electrical circuit. We’ll consider these in turn.\\nThe net current in/out of the balloon depends on the difference between the pressure in the balloon and the pressure exerted by the pump. When these two pressures are equal, the balloon is in equilibrium, and the net current is zero. The net current also depends on the size/number of holes. If the pressure in the balloon is greater than that exerted by the pump, then the net current will be outward. If the holes are big, then this net outward current will be large. The net current out of the balloon, therefore, increases with increased pressure difference and it increases if the holes are made bigger. In electrical circuits, this is called Ohm’s Law: I g = g (V m \\x00E ); (1) where I g is current through the resistor, V m is the membrane potential (i.e., the voltage between inside and outside of the neuron, modeled as the the voltage drop across both the resistor and the battery), and g is conductance.\\nThe water balloon stores water. We can deﬁne the “capacitance” of the water balloon as the volume of water it stores per unit of applied pressure, and it depends on the elasticity of the balloon.\\nGiven the same amount of water pressure from the pump, a very elastic balloon will store more water than a very stiff balloon. Likewise, an electrical capacitor stores charge. The capacitance, 2 measured in farads, is the charge per unit applied voltage: C = q =V m or q = C V m ; where C is the capacitance, q is charge, and V m is again the membrane potential.\\nAs mentioned above, when the pump is turned on the balloon expands rapidly at ﬁrst, then ever more slowly as it approaches equilibrium. While the balloon is still expanding much of the incoming water goes to ﬁll the balloon. The net current in/out of the balloon changes over time; it is a large inward current at ﬁrst (when the pump is ﬁrst turned on) and then decreases eventually to zero. The water pressure in the balloon also changes over time; it is zero at ﬁrst and then increases eventually to equal the pressure exerted by the pump.\\nFor the electrical circuit, likewise, the voltage across the capacitor and the current through the capacitor both change over time. When the switch is closed, the current through the capacitor is large at ﬁrst. Then this current drops off slowly as the capacitor charges. The voltage across the capacitor is zero when the switch is ﬁrst closed, but it increases rapidly at ﬁrst. Once in equilibrium, the voltage across the capacitor equals the voltage across the battery. It turns out that the current through the capacitor depends on the rate of change of the voltage across the capacitor: I c = dq dt = d dt (C V m ) = C dV m dt ; (2) where I c is current through the capacitor. When you look at an equation like this, it is always a good idea to check that units are correct. Electrical capacitance (C) is charge per unit voltage (coulombs/volt). Current (I c) is the rate of ﬂow of charge per unit time (amps = coulombs/sec).\\nThe time-derivative of voltage ( dV m dt ) is the rate of change in voltage per unit time (volts/sec).\\nAltogether, I c = C dV m dt , that is, amps equals coulombs/volt times volts/sec.\\nWe have formalized two different ways of thinking about the net current in/out of the balloon.\\nEquation 1 expresses the net current (I g) out of the balloon in terms of pressure difference and conductance. Equation 2 expresses the net current (I c) into the balloon in terms of rate of pressure change and capacitance. Of course, the net current into the balloon plus the net current out of the balloon must equal zero, that is, I c + I g = 0, or: C dV m dt + g (V m \\x00E ) = 0: (3) This is a ﬁrst-order, linear, ordinary differential equation that captures the full behavior of the RC circuit. We would like to know exactly how the voltage V m changes over time when the switch is closed. In other words, we would like to know the solution of this equation. Let t = 0 be the time when the switch is closed. Then, by inspection (i.e., a good guess), the solution to this equation is: V m (t) = u(t) E h 1 \\x00e \\x00(t= ) i ; (4) where = C =g, and where u(t) is the unit step function, u(t) iszero for t < 0 and u(t) is one for t > 0.\\nLet’s double check that this is the correct solution. First, take the derivate of Eq. 4: dV m dt = Æ (t) E h 1 \\x00e \\x00(t= ) i + u(t) E 1 e \\x00(t= ) ; 3 where Æ (t) is the unit impulse, that is, the derivative of the unit step u(t), Æ (t) = 1 only for t = 0, and Æ (t) = 0 otherwise. Note that the ﬁrst term is zero because the factor in brackets is zero when t = 0 and Æ (t) is zero for all other values of t. Then with some algebraic manipulation: dV m dt = u(t) E 1 e \\x00(t= ) = \\x001 n u(t) E h 1 \\x00e \\x00(t= ) i \\x00u(t) E o = \\x001 (V m \\x00u(t) E ) = \\x00g C (V m \\x00u(t) E ); So, for t \\x15 0: C dV m dt = \\x00g (V m \\x00E ); which is the same as Eq. 3.\\nInjecting Current Figure 1C shows another RC circuit, this time with the switch removed and a current clamp added.\\nA current clamp is actually a hard thing to build. For our water balloon the current clamp consists of a second special water pump 1 that can be controlled to produce variable pressure, and a current meter (a mini water wheel). The measurement from the current meter can be used to vary the pressure exerted by the pump. For example, if the current measured by the meter is lower than desired, then it will increase the pressure.\\nWith such a fancy current source, we can inject as much current as we like at any time we like.\\nIn fact, the injected current can be varied over time in any way we like. Also, the current clamp allows us to to pump water both in (positive currents) and out (negative currents) of the balloon.\\nTry to imagine what will happen to the balloon when we turn on a negative (outward ﬂowing) current. We will derive this below.\\nThere are now three branches in our circuit, each contributing a current either in or out of the balloon/neuron. As before, the sum of these three currents must be zero: C dV m dt + g (V m \\x00E ) \\x00I inject = 0; (5) where I inject is the current provided by the current clamp. Note that the injected current is sub-tracted from the other two. This is minor detail, but you have to choose a convention for what you mean by positive current. We are following the convention that the current is positive when positive charge ﬂows out of the neuron/balloon.\\nWe would like to solve this differential equation, meaning that we want to know how the membrane potential V m varies over time in response to any time-varying current injection. We will do this below, but before solving for the general case we will start with an example: a current step.\\n1We have been using the water pump as a pressure source (not a current source), analogous to the sodium-potassium pump and the battery that both act as voltage sources. In fact, this is the right way to think about a water pump. If you plug up the pump’s hose really tightly, then the pump will work really hard exerting pressure (perhaps eventually overheating) but no current will ﬂow.\\n4 50 100 150 200 250 300 −80 −70 −60 −50 −40 −30 −20 −10 0 Time (msec) Membrane potential (mV) 50 100 150 200 250 300 Time (msec) A B Figure 2: Responses of an RC circuit model of a passive neural membrane to current steps. A: g = 0:025 uS. B: g = 0:05 uS. Other parameters: E = \\x0065 mV, C = 0:5 nF. Current amplitudes are: 0, 0.25, 0.3536, 0.5, 0.707, 1, 1.41 nA.\\nIn a current step experiment, the injected current has been zero for some long enough period of time that the membrane potential is at rest, V m (0) = E. Then the current is stepped up or down to some ﬁxed value. After a while, the membrane potential achieves a new steady state value, V m (1) = V s. We want to know what this new steady state value will be, and we want to characterize the time-course of the membrane potential as it changes from E to V s. Once in steady state, dV m dt = 0, so the steady state membrane potential V s can be easily derived from Eq. 5: g (V s \\x00E ) \\x00I inject = 0; or V s = E + 1 g I inject : What about the time-course? As you might guess, from what we did earlier, the membrane poten-tial changes exponentially over time from its starting value E to its ﬁnal value V s: V m (t) = u(t) V s h 1 \\x00e \\x00(t= ) i + u(t) E h e \\x00(t= ) i : (6) At the instant when the current is ﬁrst turned on (t = 0) the ﬁrst term in square brackets is zero and V m (0) = E. A while later (t 0) the second term in square brackets is zero and V m (1) = V s. It would be a good exercise for you to verify that Eq. 6 indeed the solution to Eq. 5 for the case when I inject is a current step.\\nThe voltage time-course given by Eq. 6 is plotted in Fig. 2 for each of several different current step sizes. The current is turned on at time zero and then turned off again 150 msec later. As expected, the voltage V m rises with an exponential time course to its steady state value, then falls with an exponential time course back to the resting potential. When the conductance is doubled (in Fig. 2B), the response is attenuated (steady state voltages are reduced), but the rise/fall time is quicker. You should check Eq. 6 to verify that this is the expected behavior.\\nAbove, I asked you to imagine what would happen to the balloon by turning on a negative (outward ﬂowing) current. Now we know the answer. At ﬁrst, just before the current source is turned on, the balloon is at rest meaning that the pressure inside the balloon is equal to the pressure 5 exerted by the pump, V m (0) = E. A long time after the current source is turned on, the pressure in the balloon is V m (1) = V s = E + 1 g I inject. Since I inject is negative, V s < E, i.e., the balloon shrinks after the current is turned on. The amount of shrinkage depends on both the conductance and the injected current. A larger negative current would result in more shrinkage. A larger conductance (more holes) would result in less shrinkage.\\nThe balloon pressure changes from E to V s with an exponential time course. The time constant of the exponential, = C =g depends on both the capacitance and the conductance. A larger conductance (more holes) would yield a shorter time constant, i.e., the balloon would shrink more quickly. A larger capacitance (more elasticity) would yield a longer time constant, i.e., the balloon would shrink less quickly.\\nNow that we’ve analyzed what happens when injecting a current step, it is time to tackle the solution of Eq. 5 for the general case of an arbitrary time-varying current injection. Let’s say that the membrane starts off at rest, V m (0) = E. In the parlance of differential equations, this is called the initial condition. Then a time-varying current I inject (t) is injected. The solution is: V m (t) = E + n [I inject (t)] \\x03 h u(t) 1 C e \\x00(t= ) io ; (7) where the \\x03 means convolution, and where the u(t) is there to remind us that I inject (t) is zero for t < 0. Equivalently, we can write the desired output membrane potential with respect to the resting potential by adopting the convention that V (t) denotes voltage with respect to the resting potential, V (t) = V m (t) \\x00E: V (t) = [ I inject (t)] \\x03 h u(t) 1 C e \\x00(t= ) i : (8) This equation is derived in the Appendix I. It would be a good exercise for you to verify that Eq. 7 reduces to Eq. 6 in the case when I inject is a current step.\\nThe RC circuit (passive neural membrane) acts as a shift-invariant linear system; the output membrane potential is a blurred copy of the input injected current. Speciﬁcally, I inj ect (t) is con-volved with an exponential lowpass ﬁlter. As the injected current ﬂuctuates positive and negative, the membrane potential ﬂuctuates above and below rest, but the membrane is sluggish so it does not follow high frequency modulations in the injected current.\\nFrequency Response A passive neural membrane is a shift-invariant linear system. According to Eq. 8, the membrane potential ﬂuctuations (above and below E) may be predicted by convolving the injected current with a low-pass ﬁlter. The parameters of that low-pass ﬁlter, g and C, completely determine the behavior of the membrane.\\nSince the passive membrane is a shift-invariant linear system, we know that we have two alter-native methods for determining its parameters: (1) measure the impulse response, or (2) measure the frequency response. Following the ﬁrst approach, one would inject a very brief pulse of current and ﬁt an exponential to the measured membrane potential ﬂuctuations. However, the membrane 6 −90 −45 0 Phase (Deg) 0.2 0.5 1 2 5 10 20 50 Frequency (Hz) 20 30 40 50 60 70 Gain (mV/nA) 0.2 0.5 1 2 5 10 20 50 Frequency (Hz) Figure 3: Gain (left) and phase (right) of membrane potential ﬂuctuations in response to sinusoidal current injections of various frequencies. The dashed curves indicate the ﬁt of a single-compartment RC circuit model to the data. Fitted parameters are: g = 0:017 uS, C = 0:1595 nF (redrawn from Carandini et al., J. Neurophysiol., 76:3425-3441, 1996).\\npotential ﬂuctuations will be very small and perhaps difﬁcult to measure accurately for very brief current pulses.\\nFollowing the second approach, one would inject sinusoidal current modulations, and ﬁt the amplitude and phase of the measured sinusoidal membrane potential ﬂuctuations, for several dif-ferent frequencies. Data of this sort is plotted in Fig. 3. The data points represent amplitude and phase measurements for different current frequencies. That is, each data point represents the am-plitude/phase of the best ﬁtting sinusoid to the membrane potential measurements. The dashed curves are the best ﬁt RC circuit model, that is, they are the frequency response curves for an RC circuit with the best choices for the g and C parameters. As you can see, the ﬁts are quite good.\\nTo determine the best ﬁt g and C parameters, we need a mathematical expression for the fre-quency response of an RC circuit. The input is a sinusoidally modulating current injection: I inject (t) = sin(2\\x19 !\\nt); where ! is the frequency of modulation (in Hz), and where for simplicity we’ve taken the amplitude of current modulation to be 1 (but it could be anything). The output is a sinusoidally modulating membrane potential (again using the convention that V (t) = V m (t) \\x00E): V (t) = A(!\\n) sin [2\\x19 !\\nt + (!\\n)]; a sinusoid of the same frequency, but shifted by (!\\n) and scaled by A(!\\n). The goal is to derive expressions for A(!\\n) and (!\\n), in terms of g, C, and !. The answer is: A(!\\n) = 1 q g 2 + (2\\x19 w C ) 2 (9) 7 Gain (mV/nA) Frequency (Hz) Phase (deg) Impulse response (mV/nA/sec) 50 0 10 20 30 40 Time (msec) 0 5 10 1 64 1/4 4 16 Frequency (Hz) 1 64 1/4 4 16 0 -20 -40 -60 -80 20 40 80 100 A B C Figure 4: Impulse response (A), gain (B), and phase (C) of a passive neural membrane.

(!\\n) = \\x00tan \\x001 (2\\x19 !\\nC g ) (10) These equations are derived in Appendix II, and they were used to determine the best values of g and C for ﬁtting the data in Fig. 3.\\nFigure 4 shows how the membrane’s impulse response, amplitude, and phase depend on con-ductance. The dashed curves correspond to decreasing the conductance by a factor of 4. Decreas-ing the conductance has two effects. First, it increases the membrane’s time constant, i.e., it makes the response more sluggish. This is evident in Fig. 4A since the dashed curve has a longer tail. The change in time constant is also evident in Fig. 4B since the dashed curve starts to turn downward at a lower frequency. And the change in time constant is evident in Fig. 4C since the phase of the dashed curve lags behind that of solid curve. The second effect of decreasing the conductance is to increase the gain. This is evident in Fig. 4B since the dashed curve is above the solid curve. Even though the peaks of the two impulse responses are the same, the gains are different. Note that the dc gain (the y-intercept of each curve in Fig. 4B) equals the integral of the corresponding impulse response (Fig. 4A); the solid curve in Fig. 4A clearly has a smaller integral.\\n8 Appendix I: Derivation of Eq. 8 It is convenient to let V (t) denote voltage with respect to the resting potential, V (t) = V m (t) \\x00E.\\nIt is also convenient to assume that the injected current is zero for times t < 0. Then we begin by rewriting the membrane equation, Eq. 5, in a standard form: dV dt \\x00aV (t) = f (t); (11) where a = \\x00g C = \\x001 , and where f (t) depends on the time-varying injected current: f (t) = 1 (E + 1 g I inject ) = 1 C I inject ; since E = 0. Multiply both sides of the equation by an exponential: e \\x00at ( dV dt \\x00aV ) = e \\x00at f (t): (12) Integrating the left side from 0 to t, Z t 0 e \\x00as [ dV ds \\x00aV ]ds = e \\x00as V t 0 = e \\x00at V \\x00V (0); where V (0) = E = 0 is the initial condition. Hence, integrating both sides of Eq. 12, e \\x00at V = Z t 0 e \\x00as f (s) ds: That is, V (t) = Z t 0 e \\x00a(t\\x00s) f (s) ds This equation can be rewritten as a convolution V (t) = Z 1 0 u(t \\x00s) e \\x00a(t\\x00s) f (s) ds = Z 1 \\x001 u(t \\x00s) e \\x00a(t\\x00s) f (s) ds: The ﬁrst line follows from the fact that u(t \\x00s) = 0 for s > t (the unit step is zero before time zero), and the second line follows from the fact that f (s) = 0 for s < 0 (there is no current injected before time zero).\\nSince the last line above is the formula for a convolution we can rewrite it using the \\x03 notation: V (t) = f (t) \\x03 [u(t)e at ]: (13) Equation 13 is the solution for the standard form in Eq. 11. Now we substitute for a and f (t) to get: V (t) = I inject (t) \\x03 h u(t) 1 C e \\x00t= i ; (14) which is the same as Eq. 8 (when E = 0).\\n9 Appendix II: Derivation of Eqs. 9 and 10 It is again convenient to let V (t) denote voltage with respect to the resting potential, V (t) = V m (t) \\x00E. Then the membrane equation, Eq. 3, is: C dV dt + g V = I inject : Take the Fourier transform of both sides: F n C dV dt + g V o = F fI inject g; where ^ V (!\\n) = F fV (t)g denotes the Fourier transform of V (t). The Fourier transform is a linear transform, so we can use additivity and homogeneity to rewrite this equation: C F n dV dt o + g F fV g = F fI inject g: It turns out that there is a very simple relationship between the Fourier transform of a signal and the Fourier transform of the derivative of that signal. In particular, F n dV dt o = 2\\x19 j !\\nF fV g; where j is the square root of -1. Substituting this into the equation that precedes it gives: 2\\x19 j !\\nC ^ V (!\\n) + g ^ V (!\\n) = ^ I inject (!\\n): Rearranging terms gives an expression for the frequency response of the membrane, ^ V (!\\n): ^ V (!\\n) = ^ I inject (!\\n) g + 2\\x19 j !\\nC = ^ I inject (!\\n) g \\x002\\x19 j !\\nC g 2 + (2\\x19 !\\nC ) 2 : (15) The last step is to get rid of the complex number notation and write Eq. 15 in terms of its amplitude and phase. Since ^ V (!\\n) in Eq. 15 is the product of ^ I inject (!\\n) times a complex-valued scale factor, the amplitude of ^ V (!\\n) is the product of the amplitude of ^ I inject (!\\n) times the amplitude of that complex number. The squared amplitude of the complex-valued scale factor in Eq. 15 is: \" amplitude 1 g + 2\\x19 j !\\nC !# 2 = 1 g + 2\\x19 j !\\nC ! 1 g \\x002\\x19 j !\\nC !\\n= 1 g 2 + (2\\x19 !\\nC ) 2 So the amplitude of ^ V (!\\n) is: amplitude [ ^ V (!\\n)] = amplitude [ ^ I inject (!\\n)] q g 2 + (2\\x19 !\\nC ) 2 : (16) Likewise, the phase of ^ V (!\\n) is the sum of the phase of ^ I inject (!\\n) plus the phase of that complex-valued fraction in Eq. 15 (see the Appendix of the “Signals, Linear Systems, and Convolution” handout). The phase of the complex-valued fraction is: phase \" g \\x002\\x19 j !\\nC g 2 + (2\\x19 !\\nC ) 2 # = tan \\x001 0 @ \\x002\\x19 !\\nC g 2 +(2\\x19 !\\nC ) 2 g g 2 +(2\\x19 !\\nC ) 2 1 A = \\x00tan \\x001 \\x10 2\\x19 !\\nC g \\x11 10 So the phase of ^ V (!\\n) is: phase [ ^ V (!\\n)] = phase [ ^ I inject (!\\n)] \\x00tan \\x001 \\x10 2\\x19 !\\nC g \\x11 (17) Choosing the amplitude of the injected current to be one and the phase of the injected current to be zero in Eqs. 16 and 17 gives Eqs. 9 and 10.\\n11\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n'}}\n",

It represents the membrane as a capacitor and ion channels as voltage- and time-dependent conductances. The change in membrane potential ($x_1$) is governed by:\\n\\n$C_m \\\\frac{dx_1}{dt} = I - \\\\bar{g}_{Na} m^3 h (x_1 - E_{Na}) - \\\\bar{g}_K n^4 (x_1 - E_K) - \\\\bar{g}_l (x_1 - E_l)$ [1, 3, 4]\\n\\nHere, $m$ ($x_2$, fast activation), $h$ (fast inactivation), and $n$ ($x_3$, slow adaptation) are dimensionless gating variables. Their dynamics are described by voltage-dependent differential equations, typically of the form $\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\\\alpha_x(x_1)(1-x) - \\\\beta_x(x_1)x$, where the rate constants $\\\\alpha_x$ and $\\\\beta_x$ often include exponential functions of membrane potential [1, 4, 5].\\n\\nSimplified models include the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model, a two-dimensional system that captures spiking dynamics using polynomial terms [6, 7]. The Morris-Lecar (ML) model is another two-variable system, offering a more biophysically realistic simplification than FHN, with equations describing ionic currents [7, 8]. The Prescott model, a variant of Morris-Lecar, explicitly includes a slow adaptation variable ($z$) and various adaptation currents like voltage-gated K+ current, affecting threshold dynamics [9].\\n\\n### Sources\\n[1] Hodgkin–Huxley model - Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin–Huxley_model\\n[2] PDF: https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~gucken/PDF/hh_twist.pdf\\n[3] 2.2 Hodgkin-Huxley Model | Neuronal Dynamics online book: https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S2.html\\n[4] PDF: https://goldmanlab.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/263/2016/07/HodgkinHuxley.pdf\\n[5] Biophysical mechanism of spike threshold dependence on the rate of rise ...: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23344915/\\n[6] Fitzhugh-Nagumo Model - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics: https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/fitzhugh-nagumo-model\\n[7] PDF: https://www.math.fsu.edu/~bertram/lectures/neural_dynamics.pdf\\n[8] PDF: https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1134/S2070048217030036.pdf?pdf=button\\n[9] Contributions of adaptation currents to dynamic spike threshold on slow ...: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1007570416304154\\n\\n\\n============================================================\\nSection 3: Physically Motivated Functional Terms\\n============================================================\\nDescription:\\nThis section identifies and explains the most common and physically meaningful functional terms (e.g., powers, exponentials) extracted from established neuron models, detailing their biophysical relevance and why they frequently appear.\\nRequires Research: \\nTrue\\n\\nContent:\\n## Physically Motivated Functional Terms\\n\\nBiophysical neuron models frequently incorporate specific functional terms derived from underlying physiological processes. Linear and multiplicative terms are fundamental, representing Ohm\\'s law for ion flow, where current is proportional to conductance and voltage difference (e.g., `g(V-E)`). This accounts for passive leak currents and active ionic currents (e.g., `x_1`, `x_1*x_2`, `x_1*x_3`) [4, 5, 8].\\n\\nPolynomial terms, particularly powers, are essential for modeling voltage-gated ion channels. In the Hodgkin-Huxley model, the opening probabilities of sodium and potassium channels are represented by gating variables raised to powers like `m^3` and `n^4` (e.g., `x_2^3`, `x_3^4`), reflecting multiple independent gates [4, 8]. The FitzHugh-Nagumo model uses a cubic polynomial (`v^3`) to capture the neuron\\'s non-linear voltage dynamics [7, 8].\\n\\nExponential terms (`exp`) are crucial for describing the rapid, sharp onset of action potentials, as seen in the adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire model [4]. They also appear in the voltage-dependent rate functions (alpha and beta) that govern the kinetics of Hodgkin-Huxley gating variables [8]. Other functions like `sqrt` and `log` are not typically found as direct functional terms of the state variables in canonical neuron dynamics, but `log` can appear in the Nernst equation for calculating constant reversal potentials [5]. While a modified FitzHugh-Nagumo model can use `sin` [8], it is not a universally canonical term for intrinsic biophysical dynamics.\\n\\n### Sources\\n[1] Low-dimensional models of single neurons: a review: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37060453/\\n[2] Automatically Selecting a Suitable Integration Scheme for Systems of ...: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6186990/\\n[3] Constructing functional models from biophysically-detailed neurons: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9455888/\\n[4] Biological neuron model - Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_neuron_model\\n[5] PDF: https://opencourse.inf.ed.ac.uk/sites/default/files/https/opencourse.inf.ed.ac.uk/cns/2023/cns3neurons1.pdf\\n[6] PDF: https://diposit.ub.edu/dspace/bitstream/2445/186707/2/tfg_pairo_lopez_alexandra.pdf\\n[7] FitzHugh-Nagumo model - Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FitzHugh%E2%80%93Nagumo_model\\n[8] PDF: https://www.tnstate.edu/mathematics/mathreu/filesreu/Action_Potential_Report.pdf\\n\\n\\n============================================================\\nSection 4: Recommended Unary Operators\\n============================================================\\nDescription:\\nBased on the analysis of background equations and functional terms, this section provides justified recommendations on which unary operators ([pow, exp, sqrt, sin, cos, log]) should be included or excluded from the symbolic regression search space for this biophysical neuron system.\\nRequires Research: \\nTrue\\n\\nContent:\\n## Recommended Unary Operators\\n\\nBased on analysis of canonical biophysical neuron models, specific unary operators are recommended for the symbolic regression search space. The `pow` and `exp` operators are essential. The Hodgkin-Huxley model, a foundational neuron model, utilizes integer powers (e.g., m³ and n⁴) to represent the probability of ion channel opening, reflecting the need for multiple independent gating subunits [2, 3, 4, 5].\\n\\nExponential functions are crucial for describing the voltage-dependent rate constants (alpha and beta functions) that govern ion channel kinetics [2, 3]. The \"exponential integrate-and-fire\" model also explicitly incorporates an exponential term for spike generation [4].

This analysis culminates in justified recommendations for which mathematical operators should be included or excluded from the symbolic regression search space.\\n\\n## Variable Introduction\\n\\nThe biophysical neuron model describes the dynamics of a neuron using three state variables and a target output. The membrane potential, x₁, represents the electrical voltage across the neuron\\'s cell membrane, typically measured in millivolts (mV) [3, 5, 7]. A resting potential is often around -70 mV [3, 5]. Its dynamic fluctuations are fundamental to neuronal signaling and action potential generation [1, 3, 4].\\n\\nThe fast activation variable, x₂, models rapid ion channel dynamics, such as voltage-gated sodium channel activation, which drives quick depolarization during an action potential [1, 2, 3]. These processes occur on a fast millisecond timescale [1, 2].\\n\\nThe slow adaptation variable, x₃, captures slower biophysical processes like the activation of potassium or calcium-gated potassium currents [1, 2]. These currents mediate spike-frequency adaptation and regulate firing patterns over slower timescales [1, 2, 3].\\n\\nThe target variable, y = dx₁/dt, represents the rate of change of the membrane potential [1, 3, 4, 6, 7]. This derivative quantifies how quickly the membrane voltage changes, crucial for characterizing the rapid upstroke and repolarization phases of neuronal spikes [1, 3]. Its typical unit is millivolts per millisecond (mV/ms) [7].\\n\\n### Sources\\n[1] PDF: https://perso.u-cergy.fr/~atorcini/ARTICOLI/lezione4-zillmer.pdf\\n[2] FitzHugh-Nagumo model - Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FitzHugh–Nagumo_model\\n[3] PDF: https://www.ucl.ac.uk/~rmjbale/3307/Reading_FitzHughNagumo.pdf\\n[4] PDF: https://people.brandeis.edu/~pmiller/COMP_NEURO/lifb.pdf\\n[5] A&P1 Homework 5 & 6 Flashcards | Quizlet: https://quizlet.com/545982942/ap1-homework-5-6-flash-cards/\\n[6] 5.1 Thresholds in a nonlinear integrate-and-fire model - EPFL: https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch5.S1.html\\n[7] PDF: https://www.cns.nyu.edu/~david/handouts/membrane.pdf\\n\\n## Background Equations\\n\\nThe Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model is a canonical biophysical neuron model describing action potential initiation and propagation [1, 2]. It represents the membrane as a capacitor and ion channels as voltage- and time-dependent conductances. The change in membrane potential ($x_1$) is governed by:\\n\\n$C_m \\\\frac{dx_1}{dt} = I - \\\\bar{g}_{Na} m^3 h (x_1 - E_{Na}) - \\\\bar{g}_K n^4 (x_1 - E_K) - \\\\bar{g}_l (x_1 - E_l)$ [1, 3, 4]\\n\\nHere, $m$ ($x_2$, fast activation), $h$ (fast inactivation), and $n$ ($x_3$, slow adaptation) are dimensionless gating variables. Their dynamics are described by voltage-dependent differential equations, typically of the form $\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\\\alpha_x(x_1)(1-x) - \\\\beta_x(x_1)x$, where the rate constants $\\\\alpha_x$ and $\\\\beta_x$ often include exponential functions of membrane potential [1, 4, 5].\\n\\nSimplified models include the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model, a two-dimensional system that captures spiking dynamics using polynomial terms [6, 7]. The Morris-Lecar (ML) model is another two-variable system, offering a more biophysically realistic simplification than FHN, with equations describing ionic currents [7, 8]. The Prescott model, a variant of Morris-Lecar, explicitly includes a slow adaptation variable ($z$) and various adaptation currents like voltage-gated K+ current, affecting threshold dynamics [9].\\n\\n### Sources\\n[1] Hodgkin–Huxley model - Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin–Huxley_model\\n[2] PDF: https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~gucken/PDF/hh_twist.pdf\\n[3] 2.2 Hodgkin-Huxley Model | Neuronal Dynamics online book: https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.S2.html\\n[4] PDF: https://goldmanlab.faculty.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/263/2016/07/HodgkinHuxley.pdf\\n[5] Biophysical mechanism of spike threshold dependence on the rate of rise ...: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23344915/\\n[6] Fitzhugh-Nagumo Model - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics: https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/fitzhugh-nagumo-model\\n[7] PDF: https://www.math.fsu.edu/~bertram/lectures/neural_dynamics.pdf\\n[8] PDF: https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1134/S2070048217030036.pdf?pdf=button\\n[9] Contributions of adaptation currents to dynamic spike threshold on slow ...: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1007570416304154\\n\\n## Physically Motivated Functional Terms\\n\\nBiophysical neuron models frequently incorporate specific functional terms derived from underlying physiological processes. Linear and multiplicative terms are fundamental, representing Ohm\\'s law for ion flow, where current is proportional to conductance and voltage difference (e.g., `g(V-E)`). This accounts for passive leak currents and active ionic currents (e.g., `x_1`, `x_1*x_2`, `x_1*x_3`) [4, 5, 8].\\n\\nPolynomial terms, particularly powers, are essential for modeling voltage-gated ion channels. In the Hodgkin-Huxley model, the opening probabilities of sodium and potassium channels are represented by gating variables raised to powers like `m^3` and `n^4` (e.g., `x_2^3`, `x_3^4`), reflecting multiple independent gates [4, 8]. The FitzHugh-Nagumo model uses a cubic polynomial (`v^3`) to capture the neuron\\'s non-linear voltage dynamics [7, 8].\\n\\nExponential terms (`exp`) are crucial for describing the rapid, sharp onset of action potentials, as seen in the adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire model [4]. They also appear in the voltage-dependent rate functions (alpha and beta) that govern the kinetics of Hodgkin-Huxley gating variables [8]. Other functions like `sqrt` and `log` are not typically found as direct functional terms of the state variables in canonical neuron dynamics, but `log` can appear in the Nernst equation for calculating constant reversal potentials [5]. While a modified FitzHugh-Nagumo model can use `sin` [8], it is not a universally canonical term for intrinsic biophysical dynamics.\\n\\n### Sources\\n[1] Low-dimensional models of single neurons: a review: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37060453/\\n[2] Automatically Selecting a Suitable Integration Scheme for Systems of ...: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6186990/\\n[3] Constructing functional models from biophysically-detailed neurons: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9455888/\\n[4] Biological neuron model - Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_neuron_model\\n[5] PDF: https://opencourse.inf.ed.ac.uk/sites/default/files/https/opencourse.inf.ed.ac.uk/cns/2023/cns3neurons1.pdf\\n[6] PDF: https://diposit.ub.edu/dspace/bitstream/2445/186707/2/tfg_pairo_lopez_alexandra.pdf\\n[7] FitzHugh-Nagumo model - Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FitzHugh%E2%80%93Nagumo_model\\n[8] PDF: https://www.tnstate.edu/mathematics/mathreu/filesreu/Action_Potential_Report.pdf\\n\\n## Recommended Unary Operators\\n\\nBased on analysis of canonical biophysical neuron models, specific unary operators are recommended for the symbolic regression search space. The `pow` and `exp` operators are essential. The Hodgkin-Huxley model, a foundational neuron model, utilizes integer powers (e.g., m³ and n⁴) to represent the probability of ion channel opening, reflecting the need for multiple independent gating subunits [2, 3, 4, 5].\\n\\nExponential functions are crucial for describing the voltage-dependent rate constants (alpha and beta functions) that govern ion channel kinetics [2, 3]. The \"exponential integrate-and-fire\" model also explicitly incorporates an exponential term for spike generation [4]. These models demonstrate the fundamental role of exponential relationships in neuronal dynamics.\\n\\nConversely, `sqrt`, `sin`, `cos`, and `log` operators are generally not found in the core equations of these biophysical neuron models [2, 3, 4, 5]. While CORDIC algorithms can compute these functions [6, 10], their direct physical relevance as unary operations on the state variables (membrane potential, activation, adaptation) within the differential equations for such systems is not supported by the surveyed literature on neuron dynamics [7, 8, 9].

      "*   统计学中，近似熵`ApEn`是一种用于量化时间序列数据波动的规律性和不可预测性[1](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_46283583/article/details/124089914#fn1)的非线性分析技术。最初，规律性是通过精确的规律性统计来衡量的，其要集中在利用各种熵进行测量。然而，精确的熵计算需要大量的数据，并且结果会受到系统噪声的极大影响，因此将这些方法应用于实验数据是不切实际的。`ApEn`由Steve M. Pincus开发，通过修改精确的正则性统计量Kolmogorov-Sinai熵来处理这些限制。`ApEn`最初是为了分析医疗数据而开发的[2](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_46283583/article/details/124089914#fn2)，例如心率[1](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_46283583/article/details/124089914#fn1)，后来将其应用于金融[3](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_46283583/article/details/124089914#fn3)，生理学[4](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_46283583/article/details/124089914#fn4)和气候科学[5](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_46283583/article/details/124089914#fn5)。\n",

      "    *   采用短数据估计特征量的可以随着时间过程的发展, 采用滑动窗来估计特征参数随时间的变化。这种动态信息往往是实际工作中更需要的。\n",
      "    *   较好的抗噪和抗干扰能力。特别是对偶尔产生的瞬态强干扰有较好的承受能力；\n",
      "    *   无论信号是随机的或确定性的都可以使用，因此也可以用于随机成分和确定性；\n",
